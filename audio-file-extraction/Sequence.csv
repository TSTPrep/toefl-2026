"Speaker 1","00:00:00:00","00:00:02:15","The deadline's coming up sooner than I expected."
"Speaker 2","00:00:02:17","00:00:04:05","Looks like the meeting's running late."
"Speaker 3","00:00:04:09","00:00:06:18","Would you remind me to call my sister later?"
"Speaker 4","00:00:06:22","00:00:10:12","Could you water my plants while I'm away? Did you find your wallet?"
"Speaker 5","00:00:10:14","00:00:12:09","Have you told your parents about the trip?"
"Speaker 6","00:00:12:11","00:00:14:05","I forgot to reply to her message."
"Speaker 2","00:00:14:06","00:00:16:09","Where did you put the extra copies of the report?"
"Speaker 1","00:00:16:09","00:00:19:15","Who approved the new advertising budget."
"Speaker 2","00:00:19:17","00:00:21:01","I can't make it to the meeting tomorrow."
"Speaker 3","00:00:21:02","00:00:23:10","The hallway lights aren't working again."
"Speaker 1","00:00:23:10","00:00:28:00","The laundry baskets overflowing again. Didn't you say you do it yesterday?"
"Speaker 2","00:00:28:02","00:00:31:22","I did, but I ran out of detergent halfway through the first load."
"Speaker 1","00:00:32:03","00:00:36:02","You could have told me. I passed the store on my way home."
"Speaker 2","00:00:36:04","00:00:44:01","I figured I'd go this morning, but then I got caught up finishing that report for work. I'll grab some detergent after lunch and do a double load this afternoon."
"Speaker 1","00:00:44:04","00:00:47:16","Please do. Otherwise, we'll have nothing to wear tomorrow."
"Speaker 1","00:00:47:16","00:00:51:00","My phone keeps dying just a few hours after it's fully charged."
"Speaker 2","00:00:51:02","00:00:55:10","You probably need a new battery. How long have you had it?"
"Speaker 1","00:00:55:12","00:01:06:04","Almost four years. It used to last all day, but now I charge it twice before dinner. I read online that once a battery starts losing power, it can even damage the phone. If you ignore it for too long."
"Speaker 2","00:01:06:06","00:01:11:05","Then you'd better replace it soon. There's a repair shop near the library that does same day service."
"Speaker 1","00:01:11:11","00:01:14:20","Oh, I didn't know that. I'll head over there after work."
"Speaker 1","00:01:14:20","00:01:17:23","The shipment of office supplies still hasn't arrived."
"Speaker 2","00:01:17:24","00:01:22:18","Seriously? It's been almost a week since we placed that order."
"Speaker 1","00:01:22:19","00:01:29:07","I called the supplier this morning, and they said the delivery truck broke down outside the city. They're sending another one tomorrow."
"Speaker 2","00:01:29:08","00:01:33:21","That explains it. I'll let the team know to go easy on the printing until then."
"Speaker 1","00:01:33:21","00:01:37:18","I cancel my gym membership last month and now I regret it."
"Speaker 2","00:01:37:20","00:01:38:22","What happened?"
"Speaker 1","00:01:38:24","00:01:43:19","I thought I'd save money and just workout at home, but I haven't exercised once since then."
"Speaker 2","00:01:43:24","00:01:49:12","You could always rejoin. Sometimes they let you skip the sign up fee if you were a recent member."
"Speaker 1","00:01:49:17","00:01:52:09","That's good to know. I'll stop by this weekend and ask."
"Speaker 2","00:01:52:13","00:01:56:22","Do it. It's easier to stay motivated when you go somewhere to train."
"Speaker 1","00:01:56:22","00:02:20:08","Listen to an announcement at a university event. Good morning students. The Academic Advising Office will offer extended walk in hours next week for anyone planning to register for summer courses. Advisers will be available from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Thursday. No appointment is necessary, but please arrive early to avoid long wait times."
"Speaker 1","00:02:20:08","00:02:40:05","Listen to an announcement at a university club meeting. Hi everyone! Our club is partnering with the local Red cross to host a community blood drive next Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the Student Center ballroom. Donors should eat beforehand and bring a photo ID. If you'd like to volunteer, please sign up using the link sent in yesterday's email."
"Speaker 1","00:02:40:05","00:02:43:17","Listen to a talk in a biology class every autumn."
"Speaker 2","00:02:43:19","00:03:08:21","Millions of monarch butterflies travel from the northern United States and Canada to the mountain forests of central Mexico. Their bright orange wings make the sky seem alive with motion. What makes this journey remarkable is its length and accuracy. Monarchs travel thousands of kilometers. Get. The butterflies that arrive in Mexico are not the same ones that left the north."
"Speaker 2","00:03:08:23","00:03:40:19","The journey takes several generations to complete, with each new group continuing the route their ancestors started. Scientists have been fascinated by how monarchs know where to go. Studies suggest they use the position of the sun as a kind of compass. They also appear to rely on an internal clock that adjusts for the sun's movement during the day. Some experiments show that when the butterflies antennae are covered, they lose their sense of direction, suggesting that light sensors there play an important role."
"Speaker 2","00:03:40:21","00:04:08:20","Monarchs also respond to temperature and wind gliding on warm air currents to conserve energy during long flights. Despite their endurance, monarch populations have declined sharply in recent years. The biggest threats are habitat loss and the disappearance of milkweed plants, which are the only food source for monarch caterpillars. Conservation groups now encourage people to plant milkweed and create resting spots along the migration route."
"Speaker 2","00:04:08:22","00:04:16:11","These efforts highlight how fragile and connected natural systems can be, even when they depend on something as small as a butterfly."
"Speaker 1","00:04:16:11","00:04:19:00","Listen to a talk in the marine biology class."
"Speaker 2","00:04:19:00","00:04:46:14","In the dark depths of the ocean where sunlight never reaches. Many organisms have developed the ability to produce their own light. This natural glow, known as bioluminescence, serves a variety of purposes. Some species use it to attract prey, while others rely on it to hide from predators. But one of the most intriguing uses is communication. For many deep sea creatures, light is their language."
"Speaker 2","00:04:46:16","00:05:12:16","Certain squid, for example, flash rhythmic pulses of blue light from their bodies to signal to potential mates, or to coordinate movement within a group. In one species, these light displays become more complex during mating season, almost like a visual conversation. Other animals, such as the lantern fish, have glowing spots arranged along their sides that may help them recognize members of their own species in the darkness."
"Speaker 2","00:05:12:19","00:05:52:07","Each pattern acts like an identification badge in a place where vision is limited. Researchers studying these organisms have discovered that light production is not always controlled by the animal alone. In some cases, bacteria living inside the creature's body produce that glow. This cooperation between host and microbe shows how, even in extreme environments, life depends on partnerships. Next, let's look at how these biological light systems might inspire new forms of communication technology, such as underwater signaling devices or low energy lighting systems."
"Speaker 1","00:05:52:07","00:05:55:01","Listen to a talk in an ancient history class."
"Speaker 2","00:05:55:02","00:06:21:06","Around 10,000 years ago, in a region of the Middle East once known as the Fertile Crescent. A group of people began an experiment that would change human history. They were not building cities or empires, yet they were simply trying to survive in a landscape of grasslands and rivers that flooded each spring. Archeological evidence from sites near the Tigris and Euphrates rivers shows that small communities began gathering wild grains that grew after the floods."
"Speaker 2","00:06:21:08","00:06:49:20","Over time, they noticed that seeds dropped near their camps sprouted again the next season. This observation marked the beginning of agriculture. One of the best studied settlements from this period is Jericho, located near the Jordan River. The people there constructed circular houses from mud and built stone walls to protect their crops from animals and seasonal floods. Storage pits found beneath the floors suggest that they were saving food from one harvest to the next."
"Speaker 2","00:06:49:22","00:07:15:08","This ability to store grain gave them security through harsh seasons and allowed the population to grow. Families no longer needed to move constantly in search of food, and social roles began to change, as some members specialized in toolmaking and food preparation. These early farmers could not have known the long term consequences of their innovation. Yet their decision to plant and protect grain set in motion the rise of complex societies."
"Speaker 2","00:07:15:09","00:07:21:13","In the next section, we will look at how similar communities laid the groundwork for the first civilizations."
"Speaker 1","00:07:21:13","00:07:23:06","I'm out of coffee filters."
"Speaker 2","00:07:23:08","00:07:27:07","Could you remind me to call my mom later? Would you help me move this table?"
"Speaker 1","00:07:27:09","00:07:33:08","Did you get a chance to talk to the professor? Why was the office so quiet this morning?"
"Speaker 3","00:07:33:10","00:07:35:15","I'm not available this afternoon."
"Speaker 4","00:07:35:17","00:07:39:13","Didn't the movie start at seven? Did you finish the group project?"
"Speaker 3","00:07:39:15","00:07:44:03","I might need help setting up the projector. Isn't the grocery store open late tonight?"
"Speaker 4","00:07:44:05","00:07:46:22","Didn't you say the concert was on Friday?"
"Speaker 3","00:07:46:24","00:07:48:16","We're running low on milk again."
"Speaker 1","00:07:48:16","00:07:51:11","Can someone pick up the snacks for the meeting?"
"Speaker 2","00:07:51:13","00:07:57:07","Where did you put the extra copies of the report? What time does your train leave? Tomorrow?"
"Speaker 1","00:07:57:07","00:08:02:14","My phone alarm didn't go off this morning and I was late to work again."
"Speaker 2","00:08:02:16","00:08:03:23","Did you forget to set it?"
"Speaker 1","00:08:04:00","00:08:10:23","No. I turned the volume down last night, so I wouldn't wake my roommate, and I never turned it back up."
"Speaker 2","00:08:11:00","00:08:12:14","At least it's an easy fix."
"Speaker 1","00:08:12:16","00:08:18:12","Yeah, but my boss wasn't too happy about it. I need to get a real alarm clock."
"Speaker 1","00:08:18:12","00:08:21:14","Are you ready for the family trip this weekend?"
"Speaker 2","00:08:21:16","00:08:27:11","Almost. I packed most of the clothes last night, but I still need to grab a few things from the store."
"Speaker 1","00:08:27:13","00:08:28:13","What are you missing?"
"Speaker 2","00:08:28:16","00:08:32:13","Sunscreen and some snacks for the drive. I'll pick them up after work."
"Speaker 1","00:08:32:18","00:08:37:05","Good idea. I'll double check the hotel confirmation tonight, just to be safe."
"Speaker 2","00:08:37:07","00:08:39:09","Perfect. Then we'll be all set."
"Speaker 1","00:08:39:09","00:08:42:22","My car won't start again. I think the battery's dead."
"Speaker 2","00:08:42:24","00:08:44:22","Did you leave the lights on overnight?"
"Speaker 1","00:08:44:24","00:08:50:12","I don't remember doing that, but I must have. I was unloading groceries, and I guess I forgot to double check."
"Speaker 2","00:08:50:14","00:08:54:01","You can try jumpstarting it with my car. I have cables in the trunk."
"Speaker 1","00:08:54:07","00:08:56:12","That'd be great. I'll grab them now."
"Speaker 2","00:08:56:14","00:09:00:03","But if it happens again soon, then you probably need a new battery."
"Speaker 1","00:09:00:03","00:09:03:19","I'm thinking about signing up to volunteer at the animal shelter."
"Speaker 2","00:09:03:21","00:09:07:02","That's nice. What kind of work would you be doing there?"
"Speaker 1","00:09:07:04","00:09:14:17","Mostly walking dogs and helping clean the play area. I've never volunteered before, but it seems like a good way to spend a few hours each week."
"Speaker 2","00:09:14:19","00:09:18:07","Definitely. My cousin did that and said it was rewarding."
"Speaker 1","00:09:18:09","00:09:21:24","I hope so. I'm visiting this weekend to see what it's like."
"Speaker 1","00:09:21:24","00:09:24:23","Are you going to the Student Leadership Conference next month?"
"Speaker 2","00:09:25:01","00:09:30:06","Yes, I registered last week, but I still need to confirm which workshops I want to attend."
"Speaker 1","00:09:30:12","00:09:34:10","I haven't even signed up yet. Do you know if spots are still open?"
"Speaker 2","00:09:34:12","00:09:39:24","Probably, but the popular sessions fill quickly. I'd register tonight if I were you."
"Speaker 1","00:09:40:00","00:09:44:02","Good idea. I'll also check if the school provides transportation."
"Speaker 2","00:09:44:02","00:09:47:23","They do, but you have to reserve a seat on the shuttle in advance."
"Speaker 1","00:09:47:23","00:09:50:20","Listen to an announcement at a university event."
"Speaker 2","00:09:50:22","00:10:09:09","The Community Outreach Office is launching this semester's campus recycling challenge starting next Monday. Residence halls will compete to see who can collect the most recyclable materials over four weeks. The winning hall will receive a group pizza party. Check the university website for guidelines and weekly progress updates."
"Speaker 1","00:10:09:09","00:10:12:01","Listen to an announcement at a university event."
"Speaker 2","00:10:12:04","00:10:33:05","Hi everyone. Before we finish, I'd like to go over our updated practice schedule for the upcoming regional debate tournament. Starting next week, we'll meet every Tuesday and Thursday evening from 5 to 7 p.m. in room 214. Please review your assigned debate topics before each session so we can focus on refining rebuttals and timing."
"Speaker 1","00:10:33:05","00:10:53:13","Listen to an announcement at a university club meeting. Just a quick note for everyone involved in this semester's play. Rehearsals will begin next Monday at 6 p.m. in the Black Box Theater. Please check the posted schedule to see your assigned days. Costume fittings will take place the following week, so be sure to attend your designated session."
"Speaker 1","00:10:53:13","00:10:57:22","Listen to an announcement on the university radio station."
"Speaker 2","00:10:57:24","00:11:18:15","Hi everyone. The writing center is extending its tutoring hours during midterms starting next week. Appointments will be available until 8 p.m. Monday through Thursday. Tutors can help with essays and citation formatting. Appointments fill up quickly, so students are encouraged to book their sessions early through the writing center's website."
"Speaker 1","00:11:18:15","00:11:21:01","Listen to a talk in a biology class."
"Speaker 2","00:11:21:03","00:11:54:21","Surviving in a desert requires remarkable strategies. In places where rainfall is rare and temperatures soar. Plants have evolved specialized features that allow them to store water, reduce evaporation, and endure long periods of drought. One of the most familiar examples is the cactus. Its thick, fleshy stem acts as a reservoir, storing water collected during brief rains. The leaves have evolved into spines that protect the plant from animals while also reducing surface area, which limits water loss."
"Speaker 2","00:11:54:23","00:12:29:01","Another adaptation is timing. Many desert plants remain dormant for months, waiting for a short burst of rain before sprouting leaves and flowers. Seeds may lie buried for years until just the right conditions trigger germination. Some plants, like the creosote bush, release chemicals into the soil that prevent other plants from growing too close, conserving limited moisture for themselves. These strategies reveal how, even in extreme environments, life finds a way to balance scarcity and growth."
"Speaker 2","00:12:29:03","00:12:56:03","Scientists studying desert ecosystems have discovered that these plants also influence local climates by stabilizing soil and reducing erosion. Their survival strategies inspire engineers developing materials and technologies designed to conserve water in dry regions. In the next part of this lecture, we'll explore how similar adaptations appear in Desert Animals and what they reveal about the limits of life on Earth."
"Speaker 1","00:12:56:03","00:12:58:19","Listen to a talk in a physiology class."
"Speaker 2","00:12:58:21","00:13:24:08","Sleep is one of the body's most vital yet mysterious processes. For centuries, it was thought to be a period of complete rest. But modern research shows that the brain remains surprisingly active during sleep. It processes memories, restores energy and performs maintenance that waking life does not allow. A series of studies with students has helped scientists understand this function more clearly."
"Speaker 2","00:13:24:10","00:13:56:06","In one experiment, two groups were asked to learn a set of word pairs. One group studied in the evening and slept afterward, while the other stayed awake overnight. The next day, the group that had slept remembered far more. Brain scans showed that during deep sleep, areas involved in memory replayed patterns of activity seen during learning. This replay strengthened the connections between nerve cells, effectively transferring short term information into long term storage."
"Speaker 2","00:13:56:08","00:14:28:19","Researchers have observed similar effects in animals when rats navigate a maze and then fall asleep. Their brains repeat the same electrical patterns seen during exploration as if practicing the route. These findings suggest that sleep acts as a kind of rehearsal, turning daily experience into lasting knowledge. Despite its importance, sleep remains fragile in modern life. Bright screens, irregular schedules, and stress all interfere with its natural rhythm."
"Speaker 2","00:14:28:21","00:14:39:21","Next, we'll discuss how scientists are using brain imaging to study what happens in the mind during each stage of sleep and how this research could help treat sleep disorders."
"Speaker 1","00:14:39:21","00:14:43:00","Listen to a talk in an ecology class."
"Speaker 2","00:14:43:02","00:15:17:15","In large metropolitan areas. Temperatures often rise several degrees higher than in nearby rural regions. This pattern, known as the urban heat island effect, occurs when natural landscapes are replaced with surfaces that trap and store heat. Pavement, brick, and glass absorb sunlight throughout the day and release it slowly at night. Preventing cities from cooling. Fewer trees and open spaces mean less shade and less evaporation, both of which normally keep temperatures down."
"Speaker 2","00:15:17:17","00:15:46:10","The consequences extend beyond simple discomfort. In hotter cities, residents consume more electricity for cooling. Increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Air pollutants also react more quickly in warm air, worsening smog and respiratory problems. Urban planners have begun to address these problems by experimenting with reflective roofing materials and a new kind of park called a pocket park, which lower neighborhood temperatures."
"Speaker 2","00:15:46:12","00:16:14:18","In Los Angeles, for instance. A city program tested light colored road coatings and recorded surface temperatures several degrees lower than surrounding streets. Such efforts demonstrate how small design choices can influence the broader urban climate. Researchers studying these initiatives are now asking which combinations of vegetation, building materials, and public policies can produce the most sustainable results in rapidly growing cities."
"Speaker 1","00:16:14:18","00:16:17:19","The company picnic got postponed again."
"Speaker 2","00:16:17:21","00:16:20:07","Could you email me the directions to the party?"
"Speaker 3","00:16:20:10","00:16:25:04","Would you help me carry these boxes inside? Did you hand in your scholarship application?"
"Speaker 1","00:16:25:06","00:16:30:01","Did you remember to buy bread? Sorry, I spilled a little coffee on the counter."
"Speaker 2","00:16:30:03","00:16:32:08","I'm afraid I can't attend the ceremony."
"Speaker 1","00:16:32:08","00:16:34:12","Would you help me organize these files?"
"Speaker 1","00:16:34:12","00:16:37:01","I forgot to send the file last night."
"Speaker 2","00:16:37:03","00:16:39:11","How can I fix the jammed drawer?"
"Speaker 3","00:16:39:13","00:16:41:03","Where did you put the meeting notes?"
"Speaker 1","00:16:41:03","00:16:43:18","Are you ready for the parent teacher meeting later today?"
"Speaker 2","00:16:43:20","00:16:50:06","Almost. I reviewed the notes from last semester and I want to ask about his math progress."
"Speaker 1","00:16:50:08","00:16:54:00","I think that's a good idea. He's been struggling a bit lately."
"Speaker 2","00:16:54:05","00:16:58:08","I'll also check if there's any way to get extra credit that might help his grade."
"Speaker 1","00:16:58:14","00:17:02:04","Good thinking. Let's make a list of questions before we go."
"Speaker 1","00:17:02:04","00:17:06:19","I can't find the passport I need for my trip next week. I've checked every drawer."
"Speaker 2","00:17:06:24","00:17:11:10","Did you look inside your travel bag? You might have left it there after your last trip."
"Speaker 1","00:17:11:12","00:17:13:17","Oh, I didn't think of that. I'll check right now."
"Speaker 2","00:17:13:23","00:17:18:03","If it's not there, you can request a replacement. But it takes about a week."
"Speaker 1","00:17:18:09","00:17:21:17","That's cutting it close. I really hope it's in that bag."
"Speaker 2","00:17:21:18","00:17:24:07","Fingers crossed. Let me know if you find it."
"Speaker 1","00:17:24:07","00:17:27:08","Are you planning to go to the Community Faire next weekend?"
"Speaker 2","00:17:27:10","00:17:34:11","I am, but I haven't decided which day yet. Saturday's supposed to be sunny though, so probably then."
"Speaker 3","00:17:34:13","00:17:39:04","That's what I heard too. I want to check out the food stalls and live music."
"Speaker 2","00:17:39:10","00:17:43:02","Same here. They're even hosting a small art market this year."
"Speaker 1","00:17:43:04","00:17:45:15","Nice. Should we go together?"
"Speaker 2","00:17:45:21","00:17:49:10","Sure. I'll text you Friday night once I know what time I can make it."
"Speaker 1","00:17:49:10","00:17:52:11","Have you booked your hotel for the wedding yet?"
"Speaker 2","00:17:52:13","00:17:53:16","Not yet."
"Speaker 3","00:17:53:18","00:17:57:06","I was waiting to see if anyone wanted to share a room to cut costs."
"Speaker 1","00:17:57:08","00:18:02:02","You better do it soon. I heard most of the nearby places are filling up fast."
"Speaker 2","00:18:02:04","00:18:05:04","Thanks for the reminder. I'll take care of it tonight."
"Speaker 1","00:18:05:06","00:18:11:13","Good. Also, don't forget to RSVP for the rehearsal dinner. The couple needs a head count this week."

Starting next week, the coffee shop is expanding its breakfast menu to include fruit smoothies and sandwich options. The kitchen will also open 30 minutes earlier at 7 a.m., to help students grab something before morning classes. To celebrate the launch they are offering a free drink upgrade for anyone who brings in a reusable cup during the first week."
"Speaker 1","00:19:44:19","00:19:47:17","Listen to a talk in an ecology class."
"Speaker 2","00:19:47:19","00:20:10:16","Most people have noticed that the sound of a siren changes as an ambulance passes by. It seems higher in pitch when the vehicle approaches and lower after it moves away. This change happens because of a physical principle called the Doppler effect. When the source of a sound moves toward you, the sound waves bunched together so the pitch rises when it moves away."
"Speaker 2","00:20:10:18","00:20:40:16","The waves spread out and the pitch drops. The same idea applies to all kinds of waves, including light and radio signals. Astronomers use it to study how stars and galaxies move, but the effect also plays an important role here on Earth, especially in medicine. Doctors use something called Doppler ultrasound to look at the movement of blood through the body, by sending high frequency sound waves into a blood vessel, and measuring how those waves change as they bounce back."
"Speaker 2","00:20:40:18","00:21:13:02","Doctors can see where the blood is flowing normally or if a blockage might be present. This technique helps detect heart disease, monitor blood pressure in unborn babies, and guide surgeries where circulation must be carefully controlled. The Doppler effect may seem simple at first, but it bridges everyday experience and advanced science. It shows how one basic law of motion can help doctors save lives and give scientists new ways to understand movement, whether in the human body or across the universe."
"Speaker 1","00:21:13:02","00:21:15:21","Listen to a talk in a psychology class."
"Speaker 2","00:21:15:23","00:21:42:23","People tend to dislike losing far more than they enjoy winning. This tendency, known as loss aversion, is a central idea in behavioral economics. Experiments show that the pain of losing $50 feels stronger than the pleasure of gaining the same amount. Because of this imbalance, people often make choices that protect them from losses, even when those choices limit potential gains."
"Speaker 2","00:21:43:00","00:22:13:13","Loss aversion helps explain many patterns in everyday behavior. Investors may hold on to declining stocks because selling them would mean accepting a loss. Homeowners sometimes refuse to lower their asking price, even when the market has clearly changed. In both cases, the fear of acknowledging a loss outweighs rational calculations about future benefit. Marketers also rely on this bias. Phrases such as don't miss out or only a few left."
"Speaker 2","00:22:13:15","00:22:45:10","Tap into our instinct to avoid losing opportunities rather than to pursue new ones. Economists have learned that small changes in how choices are presented can lessen the impact of loss aversion. When people focus on long term outcomes instead of immediate results, they often make more balanced decisions. This insight has influenced policies ranging from retirement savings programs to health campaigns or framing goals, as future gains can encourage participation without triggering the powerful urge to avoid loss."
"Speaker 1","00:22:45:10","00:22:48:12","Listen to a talk in an art history class."
"Speaker 2","00:22:48:14","00:23:14:17","In the late 19th century, a group of painters in France began to challenge traditional ideas about how art should represent the world. They became known as the Impressionists. Instead of creating highly detailed, carefully outlined forms. They tried to capture the fleeting effects of light and color that defined a moment. Their goal was not to paint objects as they were, but as they appeared in a particular instant to the human eye."
"Speaker 2","00:23:14:19","00:23:41:18","Claude Monet's painting called Impression Sunrise gave the movement its name. The canvas shows a misty harbor at dawn, rendered with loose brushstrokes and shifting tones of orange and blue. Critics at the time dismissed the work as unfinished, but Monet was less interested in perfection than in perception. He painted the same scene at different hours of the day to show how changing light transformed both color and mood."
"Speaker 2","00:23:41:20","00:24:07:08","This approach reflected new ideas about vision emerging from science, which suggested that what people see depends as much on the observer as on the object being viewed. Impressionism marked a turning point in art, moving away from exact representation toward personal experience. The movement opened the door to modern painting, where artists explored how light, emotion, and memory shape what we perceive."
"Speaker 2","00:24:07:10","00:24:13:04","Let's see now how impression eventually evolved into something we refer to today as Post-Impressionism."
"Speaker 1","00:24:13:04","00:24:15:16","Where can I print this document?"
"Speaker 2","00:24:15:18","00:24:23:10","Could you look over my essay before class? Did you remember to lock the classroom? Did you book the meeting room? How do I turn off this alarm?"
"Speaker 1","00:24:23:12","00:24:34:02","How can I reach the HR department? Where can I get my phone fixed? I'm not available tomorrow. Would you mind keeping an eye on my bag? I can't seem to open this shared document."
"Speaker 1","00:24:34:02","00:24:36:10","Have you already submitted the lab report?"
"Speaker 2","00:24:36:12","00:24:40:14","How can I sign up for the research seminar? I forgot to bring my umbrella."
"Speaker 1","00:24:40:16","00:24:44:16","I'll need a ride to the airport. Didn't you already contact the supplier?"
"Speaker 2","00:24:44:19","00:24:49:10","Did you talk to the landlord about the heating? I don't think I can finish this report today."
"Speaker 1","00:24:49:10","00:24:52:13","I've been thinking about signing up for painting classes."
"Speaker 2","00:24:52:15","00:24:56:06","That sounds fun. Have you painted before?"
"Speaker 1","00:24:56:08","00:25:03:11","Not since high school, but I used to really enjoy it. I saw a studio downtown that offers evening workshops for beginners."
"Speaker 2","00:25:03:13","00:25:08:14","Oh, I've heard about that place. They provide all the supplies too. So you don't have to buy anything."
"Speaker 1","00:25:08:19","00:25:11:06","Perfect. I'll check their schedule tonight."
"Speaker 1","00:25:11:06","00:25:16:01","The kitchen faucet is dripping again. Didn't we fix that last month?"
"Speaker 2","00:25:16:03","00:25:19:12","Yeah, I replaced the washer, but it must have worn out already."
"Speaker 1","00:25:19:16","00:25:21:16","Should we just call a plumber this time?"
"Speaker 2","00:25:21:20","00:25:27:01","Maybe, but let me check it first. If it's the same part, I can swap it out in ten minutes."
"Speaker 1","00:25:27:05","00:25:30:19","Fine. But if it starts leaking again, I'm making the call."
"Speaker 1","00:25:30:19","00:25:33:01","Did you see a package outside the door just now?"
"Speaker 2","00:25:33:03","00:25:37:10","Yeah, but it wasn't ours again. It was for the apartment upstairs."
"Speaker 1","00:25:37:12","00:25:42:08","That keeps happening. Maybe the delivery driver can't read the numbers clearly."
"Speaker 2","00:25:42:10","00:25:47:24","I'll bring it up to them when I pass by. And maybe I'll put a larger label on our mailbox so it's easier to see."
"Speaker 1","00:25:48:01","00:25:52:01","That's a good idea. Hopefully this stops the mix ups."
"Speaker 2","00:25:52:03","00:25:53:03","Fingers crossed."

"Speaker 1","00:26:00:13","00:26:05:19","You should probably call the office just in case. They usually fill canceled slots fast."
"Speaker 3","00:26:05:23","00:26:09:16","Good idea. I don't want to lose the appointment completely."
"Speaker 1","00:26:09:18","00:26:13:12","I'll cover dinner tonight if you pick something up on your way back home."
"Speaker 4","00:26:13:14","00:26:16:18","Deal. Hopefully my mouth won't be too sore."
"Speaker 1","00:26:16:18","00:26:19:01","Did you finish submitting the lab report?"
"Speaker 2","00:26:19:06","00:26:24:09","Not yet. The submission page keeps freezing, and I can't tell if it actually went through."
"Speaker 1","00:26:24:13","00:26:29:20","That happened to me earlier. I refresh the browser and it finally worked on the third try."
"Speaker 2","00:26:29:21","00:26:33:00","Good to know. I'll try that before the 5:00 deadline."
"Speaker 1","00:26:33:00","00:26:39:22","And if it still doesn't upload, just email the file to the professor. He said he'll accept it that way if there's a problem."

"Speaker 2","00:28:02:18","00:28:23:01","And just a quick reminder about our annual fundraising walk for local shelters. It'll take place this Sunday at Riverside Park beginning at 9 a.m.. Volunteers should arrive by 830 to help with set up and registration. Remember to wear comfortable shoes and bring water. All donations collected will go directly toward winter supplies for families in need."
"Speaker 1","00:28:23:01","00:28:25:15","Listen to a talk in a music class."
"Speaker 2","00:28:25:17","00:28:51:02","Repetition is one of the most fundamental elements in music. It gives a song structure, helps listeners recognize patterns and creates emotional tension, and release. A familiar melody or rhythm, repeated at just the right moment, can turn a simple sequence of notes into something memorable. Composers have used repetition for centuries, but its purpose and effect have changed depending on style and context."
"Speaker 2","00:28:51:03","00:29:26:17","In classical symphonies, repetition helped listeners follow long, complex movements. A theme might return in a new key or tempo, reminding the audience of what came before. While showing how the piece has evolved. In popular music, repetition serves a different function. The looping rhythms of hip hop, the repeated hooks in pop songs, and the minimalist beats of electronic music all create a sense of anticipation when a phrase repeats with a subtle variation, an added instrument, a shift in harmony, it captures attention and deepens engagement."
"Speaker 2","00:29:26:18","00:29:54:00","Neuroscientists studying how people respond to music have found that repetition activates reward centers in the brain. Each return of a familiar sound triggers a small sense of satisfaction. This might explain why listeners often replay songs over and over again. Repetition. Far from being a sign of simplicity, may be what makes music feel alive. Giving form to emotion through familiarity and surprise."
"Speaker 1","00:29:54:00","00:29:57:01","Listen to a talk in an ecology class."
"Speaker 2","00:29:57:03","00:30:20:24","In many ecosystems, the survival of both plants and animals depends on the work of pollinators. Bees are among the most important. When a honeybee visits a flower, it collects nectar to make honey, and at the same time gathers grains of pollen on its body. As the bee moves from flower to flower, that pollen is transferred, allowing the plants to reproduce."
"Speaker 2","00:30:21:01","00:30:47:17","This exchange may seem small, but it sustains entire landscapes of flowering plants and the food chains that depend on them. A good illustration of this can be seen in California's almond orchards. Each spring, billions of blossoms appear for only a short period, and every flower must be pollinated to produce an almond. Farmers bring in thousands of beehives from across the country to ensure success."
"Speaker 2","00:30:47:19","00:31:21:11","When the bees thrive. The trees are heavy with fruit. When they suffer. Production drops sharply. In recent years, scientists have noticed that hives placed near fields with wildflowers and native shrubs tend to stay healthier than those surrounded by uniform farmland. These mixed environments provide bees with steady sources of food and shelter. After the almond bloom ends. This connection between crop success and bee health demonstrates how closely human activity and natural systems are linked."
"Speaker 2","00:31:21:13","00:31:26:10","Protecting pollinators is not simply an environmental issue, but an economic one."
"Speaker 1","00:31:26:10","00:31:29:05","We're short one. Volunteer for the event."
"Speaker 2","00:31:29:07","00:31:35:04","I need someone to cover my shift tonight. Can someone take notes during the meeting?"
"Speaker 1","00:31:35:06","00:31:41:20","Didn't you say you were free tonight? Thanks again for waiting for me. We have to cancel the study group today."

"Speaker 1","00:31:46:12","00:31:48:11","Where's the nearest coffee shop?"
"Speaker 2","00:31:48:13","00:31:50:22","Why won't this door lock properly?"
"Speaker 1","00:31:50:22","00:31:53:08","Would you mind checking this proposal for errors?"
"Speaker 2","00:31:53:10","00:32:00:23","Isn't the grocery store open until midnight? Where can I submit my application form? I can't believe how crowded the cafeteria is."
"Speaker 1","00:32:00:24","00:32:02:22","Why is the TV volume so low?"
"Speaker 2","00:32:02:22","00:32:05:00","I'm having trouble logging in again."

"Speaker 2","00:32:09:18","00:32:12:21","Really? I was planning to walk to the market after lunch."
"Speaker 1","00:32:13:01","00:32:21:11","I'd bring an umbrella just in case. The forecast said heavy rain and strong wind, especially around three. It might be better to go earlier while it's still light outside."
"Speaker 2","00:32:21:12","00:32:24:18","Good idea. I'll head out right after I finish these emails."
"Speaker 1","00:32:24:23","00:32:27:22","Want me to come with you? I need to pick up a few things to."

"Speaker 2","00:32:31:02","00:32:34:22","That's a great idea. What kind of food do you want to start with?"
"Speaker 1","00:32:34:23","00:32:39:02","Maybe something simple like stir fry or roasted vegetables."
"Speaker 2","00:32:39:03","00:32:44:08","Start with recipes that use the same ingredients in different ways. It helps you waste less food."
"Speaker 1","00:32:44:09","00:32:47:15","Good point. Do you have a favorite site for beginners?"

"Speaker 1","00:33:16:14","00:33:22:12","My washing machine stopped mid cycle again. It's full of water and won't drain."
"Speaker 2","00:33:22:14","00:33:28:13","Did you try unplugging it and plugging it back in? Sometimes that resets the system."
"Speaker 1","00:33:28:15","00:33:31:22","Not yet. I was worried I'd make it worse."
"Speaker 2","00:33:31:24","00:33:41:05","It's worth a try if that doesn't work. Check the filter near the bottom. It might be clogged. That actually happened to my washing machine last month."
"Speaker 1","00:33:41:07","00:33:45:02","I'll look at it tonight. If nothing helps, I'll call the repair center tomorrow."

"Speaker 1","00:35:24:06","00:35:27:11","Listen to a talk in a psychology class."
"Speaker 2","00:35:27:13","00:35:55:12","Modern consumers enjoy more freedom than ever before. Supermarkets offer dozens of cereal brands, and streaming services provide thousands of movies and shows. Yet psychologists have observed that having too many options can actually make people less satisfied. A phenomenon known as the paradox of choice. While choice can create a sense of control, an excess of it often leads to anxiety, hesitation, and regret."
"Speaker 2","00:35:55:14","00:36:20:08","In one well-known study, shoppers were presented with different numbers of jam flavors to sample. Those offered six flavors were more likely to buy a jar than those who faced 24 when choices multiplied. People struggled to compare options and worried about missing out on the best one. This pattern appears in many areas of life. Job seekers, for instance, may feel overwhelmed by endless online listings."
"Speaker 2","00:36:20:10","00:36:52:18","While students choosing majors often fear making the wrong decision and postpone committing to one. Companies have started to recognize this paradox. Some simplify their products or use algorithms to narrow down recommendations, reducing the mental burden on consumers. Streaming platforms, for example, use viewing history to highlight shows a person is likely to enjoy guiding rather than overwhelming them. The paradox of choice reminds us that freedom does not always equal happiness."
"Speaker 2","00:36:52:20","00:36:58:17","Real satisfaction often comes not from endless options, but from confidence in the choices we make."
