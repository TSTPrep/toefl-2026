## Key Features (Chat GPT ideas)

### Passage Itself

* 40-60 words
* 30% announcements, 70% emails
* 2 questions each
* Genres:
  * Confirmations/Reservations: appointments, classes, restaurants, workshops.
  * Notices/Memos: reschedules, maintenance, service outages, policy updates.
  * Invitations: events, community gatherings, training sessions.
  * Short announcements: posters, flyers, online posts.
  * Simple workplace communication: meeting updates, team reminders, student emails to professors.
* Very close to TOEIC Part 7 but framed as TOEFL “Daily Life.”
* These reflect real-world, non-academic reading—banking, housing, school, events, work.
* CEFR B1–B2 range: everyday vocabulary, formal-but-simple register.
* Frequent verbs: confirm, reschedule, provide, attend, require, notify, register.
* Short, direct sentences. Avoid idioms or culturally specific slang.
* Tips for Generating New Passages
  * Start with the container: Is this an email, notice, memo, flyer, confirmation?
  * Anchor around a date/time: Always include one (easy question source).
  * Add 1 requirement or condition: (Bring ID, arrive early, confirm RSVP).
  * Include 1 inference-friendly clue: (Policy reason, tone, implied relationship).
  * Keep distractors plausible: Slightly off times, similar-sounding items, roles that are logical but unsupported.
* Mix contexts:
  * Campus (library hours, class registration, maintenance).
  * Community (fairs, workshops, volunteer events).
  * Workplace (meeting updates, HR notices, IT maintenance).
  * Services (banking, dining, healthcare, housing).
* Common Features
  * Time-sensitive info: appointment times, meeting schedules, deadlines.
  * Requirements/conditions: what to bring, who must be present, how to cancel.
  * Politeness formulas: “Best regards,” “Thank you,” “Please arrive 10 minutes early.”
  * Professional/neutral tone (no humor, minimal emotion, except in friendly notices).

### The Questions (Based on ETS’ 12 examples)
