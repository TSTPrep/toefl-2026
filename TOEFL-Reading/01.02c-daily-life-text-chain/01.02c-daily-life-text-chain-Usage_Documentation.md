## Overview
The "Daily Life Text Chain" question type focuses on passages structured like chat logs or group texts (120-200 words). These passages feature multiple speakers, short conversational messages, and emphasize task coordination. They are followed by three questions, primarily focusing on Gist Purpose, Factual Information, Negative Factual Information, and Inference.

## Generation Process
1.  **Passage Generation:**
    *   Generate passages that are 120-200 words long, including repeated names.
    *   Structure the passage as a chat log or group text.
    *   Ensure each entry begins with `name + timestamp`.
    *   Use short, conversational messages rather than paragraphs.
    *   Clearly define roles and contributions for each participant (usually 3-5 speakers).
    *   Include embedded clues for inference (e.g., brief callbacks like “We know what happened last time”).
    *   Maintain consistency with real-life chats: timestamps close together, short sentences, but avoid slang.
    *   Ensure later messages build on earlier ones.
    *   Maintain an informal but professional tone (colleagues, classmates, project teams).
    *   Emphasize task coordination (who does what, by when, and why) and team collaboration around shared deadlines or projects.
    *   Common contexts: marketing launch, software update, group assignments, event planning, internal work coordination.

2.  **Question Generation:**
    *   Generate three questions per passage.
    *   **Gist Purpose:**
        *   Should be in 20% of texts.
        *   Wording: "What is the main purpose of the (messages)?"
    *   **Factual Information:**
        *   Always at least one; 70% of the time, two factual information questions.
        *   Wording: Typically starts with “What, when, why, or how.” Exceptions like “On June 13, the staff can expect messages about.”
    *   **Negative Factual Information:**
        *   10% of texts will have one (at most one per passage).
        *   Wording: Must include "NOT" or "EXCEPT" in all caps (e.g., "Rebecca Yang's team does NOT include:").
    *   **Inference:**
        *   90% of texts will have one; 25% of the time, two inference questions.
        *   Wording: Varies, often uses "suggest" or "infer" (e.g., "What can be inferred about participants of the webinar?", "At 10:20 A.M., what does Ms. Velez imply when she writes, 'We know what happened last time'?").

3.  **Answer Choices:**
    *   Wrong answers often flip responsibilities among participants.
    *   Some are plausible but slightly off (e.g., “reviewing” vs. “designing”).
    *   Implication questions include a positive-sounding but incorrect option (e.g., “client was especially pleased”).

## Feedback Integration (from .clinerules/toefl-2026.md)
*   **Avoid "for example":** Do not explicitly use the phrase "for example." Just provide the example directly.
*   **No big lists:** Eliminate long lists in both complete and incomplete sentences.
*   **Split missing letters:** If applicable, split missing letters across two sentences. The first sentence can have most, and the second can have missing letters only at the beginning.
*   **Two complete sentences at the end:** Ensure there are two complete sentences after any missing letter sections.
*   **Varied opening sentences:** Do not always use an obvious “xxx is yyy” opening.
*   **Layman's terms vocabulary:** Avoid overly technical vocabulary. Aim for freshman-level university textbook language that a newcomer would understand. The trickiest word in ETS samples was "cognitive."
*   **Avoid proper nouns in later sentences:** The second and third sentences should ideally not use proper nouns.
*   **Concise final sentences:** Avoid long-winded final sentences.
*   **No lists in incomplete sentences:** Ensure sentences with missing letters do not contain lists, as this makes it too difficult for students.
*   **Variety in sentence structure:** Introduce more variety in sentence structure beyond the opening sentence.
