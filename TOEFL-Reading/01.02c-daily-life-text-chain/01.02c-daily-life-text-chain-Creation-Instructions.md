## Read in Daily Life - Chat GPT Notes (Long) - Link
* 120 - 200 words long (including names repeated)
* Structured like a chat log or group text
* Each entry begins with name + timestamp.
* Short, conversational messages rather than paragraphs.
* Clarity of Roles: Make sure each participant has a distinct responsibility or contribution.
* Embedded Clues for Inference: Add brief callbacks (‚ÄúWe know what happened last time‚Äù) or clarifications.
* Balance: 1‚Äì2 ‚Äúwhat is X doing?‚Äù detail questions, plus 1 inference/implication question.
* Consistency with Real-Life Chats: Keep timestamps close together, use short sentences, but avoid slang.
* Multiple speakers (usually 3‚Äì5 participants).
* Order matters: later messages build on earlier ones.
* Informal but professional tone (colleagues, classmates, project teams).
* Emphasis on task coordination (who does what, by when, and why).
* Team collaboration around a shared deadline or project.
* About the questions:
   * Wrong answers often flip responsibilities among participants.
   * Some are plausible but slightly off (e.g., ‚Äúreviewing‚Äù vs. ‚Äúdesigning‚Äù).
   * Implication questions include a positive-sounding but incorrect option (e.g., ‚Äúclient was especially pleased‚Äù).
* Common contexts:
   * Marketing launch (ETS sample #1)
   * Software update (ETS sample #2)
   * Group assignments for school
   * Event planning among volunteers
   * Internal work coordination (reports, presentations, etc.)
