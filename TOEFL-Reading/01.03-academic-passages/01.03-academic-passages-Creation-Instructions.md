## ETS Examples

### The Mirror Test
Very young children cannot recognize themselves in a mirror; they usually achieve this milestone around 18 months of age. The ability to recognize oneself in the mirror is considered to be a key component of self-awareness and consciousness for humans. But what about animals?

For many years, scientists have known that members of the great ape family could recognize themselves in mirrors. They measured this by the "mirror test," which involved putting a colored mark on an ape's body, and then showing the ape its reflection in a mirror. If the ape tried to remove the mark on its own body, the scientists knew that the ape was recognizing its reflection.
Apes are close relatives of humans, but in recent years, scientists have discovered that other animals also pass the "mirror test." Elephants and dolphins have shown signs of self-recognition. These, like apes, are highly intelligent animals. But in a more recent experiment, a type offish called the cleaner fish tried to scrape a mark off its body when it saw itself in the mirror. This suggests that even less intelligent animals may possess more self-awareness than previously suspected.

What is the passage mainly about?
1. Stages of early childhood development
2. Research on animal cognition
3. Differences between apes, elephants, and dolphins
4. Recent experiments on fish

(gist-content)

The word "milestone" in the first sentence is closest in meaning to
1. Accomplishment
2. Distance
3. Weight
4. Discovery

(Vocabulary)

1. It made it possible to track the animals' movements
2. It helped them determine whether the animals recognized themselves
3. It made it easier to tell the animals apart
4. It showed whether some animals can detect color differences

(Factual information)

According to the passage, all of the following are true about elephants EXCEPT:

1. They can recognize themselves in mirrors.
2. They are highly intelligent animals.
3. They possess qualities in common with apes.
4. They understand certain signs from other animals

(negative factual information)

Why does the author mention cleaner fish?

1. To suggest that a wide range of animals may possess self-awareness
2. To imply that ocean animals are highly intelligent
3. To demonstrate a flaw in a recent experiment
4. To provide an example of an animal that does not recognize itself

(Author’s Purpose)

### The Paradox of Choice
The paradox of choice, a concept popularized by psychologist Barry Schwartz, suggests that more options can lead to less satisfaction. While the freedom to choose is fundamental to consumer culture, an overabundance of choices-from groceries to electronics-can overwhelm individuals, causing anxiety and decision fatigue. This paradox implies that the vast array of possibilities available today might actually diminish consumer contentment, as the fear of making the wrong choice looms large.

Research supports this notion. In an experiment, psychologist Sheena Iyengar found that shoppers were more likely to purchase jam when offered 6 varieties instead of 24. The limited selection eased the decision process, reducing the pressure to find the 'perfect' option and making the experience more enjoyable. This phenomenon reveals that fewer choices can sometimes make consumers happier, which is a valuable insight for marketers and retailers aiming to boost satisfaction by curating their offerings.

The paradox also has broader implications. In individualistic cultures, where personal choice is highly valued, the burden of decision-making can be significant. Conversely, collectivist cultures, which often provide fewer choices, report higher levels of contentment. This dynamic suggests that understanding cultural differences in consumer psychology can help businesses optimize their product strategies and enhance overall well-being.

Which of the following best states a main idea of the passage?
(A) Effective marketing strategies focus on increasing product options.
(B) Modern consumer culture is driven by a demand for fewer products.

### The Human Microbiome
The human microbiome consists of trillions of microorganisms living in and on our bodies. These include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microbes. They play a pivotal role in functions such as digestion, immunity, and mood regulation. For instance, gut bacteria help break down food and produce essential vitamins.

Recent studies show that the microbiome can be influenced by diet, lifestyle, and medication. Antibiotics, while effective against harmful bacteria, can disrupt the balance of beneficial microbes. This disruption can lead to health issues like digestive problems and weakened immunity. Researchers are exploring the connection between the microbiome and mental health. Certain gut bacteria produce neurotransmitters affecting brain function. An imbalance in these bacteria may be linked to conditions like depression and anxiety.

Maintaining a healthy microbiome involves eating a varied diet rich in fiber, reducing stress, and avoiding unnecessary antibiotics. Bacteria that aid digestion, known as robiotics and prebiotics, are also beneficial. As understanding of the microbiome grows, it may lead to breakthroughs in treating diseases and improving health.

### The Effects of Urbanization on Bird Populations
Urbanization has had a profound impact on bird populations worldwide. As cities expand, natural habitats are replaced with buildings, roads, and other infrastructure. This leads to a significant reduction in the availability of nesting sites and food sources for birds.

Some species, such as pigeons and sparrows, have adapted well to urban environments, taking advantage of the new resources and structures. However, many other species struggle to survive in these altered landscapes. Therefore, it is imperative to find solutions that help birds adapt to city life. One notable effect of urbanization is the change in bird song. Birds living in cities often sing at higher pitches and volumes than their rural counterparts. This adaptation helps them communicate over the noise of traffic and human activity. Additionally, the artificial lighting in cities can disrupt the natural circadian (daily time­ related) rhythms of birds, affecting their breeding and feeding behaviors.

Conservationists are working to mitigate the negative effects of urbanization on birds. Initiatives such as creating urban green spaces, constructing bird-friendly buildings, and reducing light pollution are being implemented. These efforts aim to create a more hospitable environment for birds, allowing them to coexist with humans in urban settings.

### The History of Photography
The history of photography is marked by significant technological progress and artistic innovation. It began in the early nineteenth century with the invention of the camera obscura, a device that projected images onto a surface. The first permanent photograph was created by Joseph-Nicephore Niepce in1826 using a process called heliography, which required several hours of exposure to light.

Photography quickly evolved with the development of daguerreotypes, introduced by Louis Daguerre in 1839. This method produced detailed images on silver-plated copper, but daguerreotypes needed delicate handling, and the exposure times required, although much shorter, still remained impractical for recording images of moving objects. The invention of the calotype by William Henry Fox Talbot in the 1840s allowed for multiple copies of an image to be made from a single negative, revolutionizing the field.

(A) In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the introduction of film and roll cameras made photography more accessible to the public. (B) George Eastman's establishment of the Kodak company in1888 played a crucial role in this democratization, as his cameras were simple to use and affordable. (C) Today, digital photography has further transformed the medium, allowing instant image capture and sharing. (D)

### Aqueducts
Aqueducts were designed to transport water from distant sources into cities and agricultural areas, and they were crucial engineering feats in ancient civilizations. This engineering marvel allowed civilizations to thrive in otherwise inhospitable environments.

The Romans, in particular, mastered the construction of aqueducts, building extensive networks that supplied water to urban centers. These structures used a combination of gravity and meticulously calculated gradients to ensure a steady flow of water. Some Roman aqueducts, like the Pont du Gard in France, are still standing today, showcasing the Romans' remarkable engineering skills. In addition to providing water for drinking and irrigation, aqueducts were integral to public health and sanitation. They supplied water to public baths, helping to maintain hygiene in densely populated urban areas. The availability of fresh water also supported the growth of cities and the expansion of the Roman Empire.

Building aqueducts was a complex and labor-intensive process. Workers had to carve channels through mountains and construct bridges over valleys. Despite these challenges, the benefits of aqueducts far outweighed the difficulties. The legacy of Roman aqueducts continues to influence modern water management systems, highlighting the importance of sustainable engineering practices.

### Sleep Patterns
Sleep patterns vary considerably among different animal species. Some animals, like dolphins, have unique sleep methods. Dolphins practice unihemispheric slow-wave sleep, meaning one half of their brain sleeps while the other remains awake. This adaptation allows them to surface for air and stay alert for predators even while resting.

Birds also display interesting sleep behaviors. Many bird species can sleep while flying. (A) During long migratory flights, some birds may engage in unihemispheric sleep, similar to dolphins, enabling them to navigate and avoid threats. (B) Additionally, certain birds can sleep with both hemispheres of their brain but in short bursts, allowing them to maintain continuous flight for extended periods.

(C) Sleep patterns have evolved based on environmental needs. For example, grazing animals like cows and horses sleep minimally, often standing up, which helps them stay vigilant against predators. (D) In contrast, predators such as lions and tigers can afford longer, deeper sleep because they face fewer threats. Understanding these varied sleep patterns provides insight into how animals have adapted to their habitats and survival challenges. The balance between rest and vigilance is crucial for survival, revealing the intricate adaptations across the animal kingdom.

### The Power of Music
Music has the remarkable ability to influence our emotions, behavior, and physical health. Studies show that listening to music can reduce stress, alleviate pain, and improve cognitive function. It is no surprise that music therapy has become an integral part of treatment for various conditions.

Music affects the brain by triggering the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin, which are associated with pleasure and mood regulation. Fast-paced music can energize us, while slower tempos can calm us down. This is why workout playlists often feature upbeat songs, while relaxation playlists include soothing melodies.

Beyond personal well-being, music also plays a crucial role in social interactions. It can strengthen bonds, create a sense of unity, and influence social movements. Chanting and singing have been used in protests and rallies to motivate and unify participants. Despite its benefits, not all music has a positive impact. Loud and aggressive music can sometimes increase stress and anxiety levels. Understanding the power of music and its effects can help us make informed choices about what we listen to and how we use it in our daily lives.

### Agricultural Economists
Agricultural economics has undergone significant changes, driven by advancements in technology and shifts in consumer demand. Precision farming utilizes satellite imagery to enhance crop yields by analyzing soil and weather conditions. This allows farmers to make informed decisions about planting, watering, and harvesting, which in turn increase efficiency and reduce waste.

Another development is the rise of organic farming, which responds to consumer preference for sustainable products. Organic farming avoids synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, focusing on crop rotation, composting, and biological pest control. This practice has environmental benefits and creates niche markets for farmers.

Global trade also impacts agricultural economics. Nations depend on importing and exporting food to meet domestic needs and take advantage of international prices. However, this interdependency can lead to economic vulnerability when global supply chains are disrupted by political instability or natural disasters.

Innovations and global dynamics can also pose other challenges.
Precision farming requires significant investment in technology, which can be prohibitive for small-scale farmers. Organic farming often yields lower outputs than conventional methods, complicating the balance between sustainability and food security. Additionally, reliance on global trade exposes countries to fluctuations in international markets, necessitating robust economic policies to manage these risks.

### Ocean Acidification
Ocean acidification is a significant environmental issue resulting from increased carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere. When CO2 dissolves in seawater, it forms carbonic acid, which lowers the ocean's pH. This change in acidity affects marine life, particularly organisms with calcium carbonate shells, such as corals, mollusks, and some plankton species.

Coral reefs are among the most affected by ocean acidification. The acidic water makes it difficult for corals to maintain their calcium carbonate skeletons, leading to weakened structures and increased vulnerability to erosion and breakage. This process also disrupts the symbiotic relationships between corals and algae, further harming reef ecosystems.

Mollusks, including oysters and clams, struggle to develop their shells in acidic conditions, which can lead to reduced survival rates and impact the aquaculture industry. Plankton, at the base of the marine food web, also faces challenges, as their shells become more fragile, affecting their ability to reproduce and survive.

Efforts to mitigate ocean acidification include reducing CO2 emissions, protecting marine areas, and researching adaptive strategies for marine life. Addressing this issue is crucial for preserving biodiversity and maintaining the health of marine ecosystems.

AUTHOR’S PURPOSE

### Stealth Technology
Stealth technology is designed to make military assets, like aircraft, ships, and missiles, harder to detect by radar. This goal is achieved by reducing the reflection and emission of radar waves. One method involves using materials that absorb radar waves. Another method shapes the surfaces of these assets to deflect radar waves away from the radar receiver.

The F-117 Nighthawk, developed during the 1970s, was the first operational stealth aircraft. Its angular design made it difficult for radar to detect, though it had limitations. Subsequent advancements led to aircraft like the B-2 Spirit bomber, which features smoother surfaces and radar-absorbing paint. These improvements not only enhanced stealth but also influenced designs of other military vehicles. Stealth technology extends beyond aircraft. Modern naval vessels employ angled surfaces and radar-absorbent coatings to minimize their radar signature. Submarines utilize stealth through hulls that are designed to reduce sonar detection.

Despite its advantages, the complexity and cost of stealth technology limit its availability to only a few countries. Ongoing research aims to improve effectiveness and affordability, potentially expanding its usage in future military applications. However, these advancements also raise concerns about an escalating arms race and the ethical implications of increasingly undetectable weaponry.

### The Role of Fungi on Ecosystems
Fungi play a crucial role in ecosystems, often working behind the scenes to decompose organic matter and recycle nutrients. Unlike plants, fungi do not photosynthesize; instead, they obtain energy by breaking down dead plants and animals. This decomposition process is essential for nutrient cycling, as it releases vital elements like nitrogen and phosphorus back into the soil, supporting new plant growth. Their role in nutrient cycling is indispensable for healthy ecosystems.

One fascinating group of fungi is mycorrhizal fungi, which form symbiotic relationships with plant roots. These fungi extend the root system of plants, allowing them to access water and nutrients more efficiently. In return, the plants provide the fungi with carbohydrates produced through photosynthesis. This mutually beneficial relationship enhances plant growth and resilience, particularly in nutrient-poor soils.

Not all fungi are beneficial. Some pathogenic fungi cause diseases in plants and animals, leading to significant agricultural and ecological impacts. For example, the chytrid fungus has devastated amphibian populations worldwide. Understanding the diverse roles of fungi in ecosystems can help scientists develop strategies to mitigate their negative effects while leveraging their benefits for environmental sustainability.

### Renewable Energy Sources
Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, are increasingly gaining attention as alternatives to fossil fuels. Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity, providing a clean and abundant energy source. Wind turbines harness the power of wind, while hydroelectric plants use flowing water to generate electricity. These technologies offer significant environmental benefits, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions and decreased reliance on non-renewable resources.

However, renewable energy is not without its challenges. Solar and wind energy are intermittent, meaning they can be inconsistent depending on weather conditions. This intermittency requires the development of advanced storage solutions to ensure a steady supply of electricity. Additionally, the initial cost of installing renewable energy infrastructure can be high, although long-term savings and environmental benefits often outweigh this investment.

Recent innovations are addressing these issues. For instance, researchers are developing more efficient solar panels and energy storage systems that can store excess power generated during peak times. Wind turbines are being designed to operate in lower wind speeds, increasing their efficiency. Governments and private companies are also investing in renewable energy projects, recognizing the importance of transitioning to sustainable energy sources.
