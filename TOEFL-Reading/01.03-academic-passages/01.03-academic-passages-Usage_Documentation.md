# 01.03, TOEFL Reading, Academic Passages, Usage Documentation

This document outlines the usage and generation process for the "Academic Passages" question type.

## Overview
The "Academic Passages" question type focuses on longer, academic-toned passages (165-210 words, 2-4 paragraphs) that do not require background knowledge. These passages have a clear structure (intro → explanation → examples → broader implications or conclusion) and are followed by 5 questions covering factual information, vocabulary, inference, organization, author’s purpose, negative factual information, insert text, and gist-content.

## Generation Process
1.  **Passage Generation:**
    *   Generate passages that are 165-210 words long, structured into 2-4 paragraphs.
    *   Ensure each passage has a clear structure: introduction → explanation → examples → broader implications or conclusion.
    *   Write in a neutral, academic tone, similar to a simplified university-level textbook or lecture.
    *   Use moderately complex sentences, but avoid overly dense language. Introduce technical terms with short explanations.
    *   Avoid personal opinions; present facts, research findings, or historical accounts.
    *   The opening paragraph should introduce the topic straightforwardly.
    *   Middle paragraphs should provide evidence, examples, case studies, or contrasting perspectives.
    *   The final paragraph should often widen the lens, discussing significance, implications, or ongoing research.
    *   Imagine writing a short, engaging, entry-level textbook section on a topic a curious college freshman might encounter for the first time. It should be fact-based, accessible, structured, and balanced with both examples and implications.

2.  **Question Generation:**
    *   Generate 5 questions per passage.
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   80% of the time, this is the first question. 5% of passages will have 0 vocabulary questions.
        *   Almost always an academic word (no phrases).
        *   90% of the time, the vocabulary word is in order (e.g., if it's the first question, the word is in the first paragraph). Keep questions in sequential order.
    *   **Factual Information:**
        *   1-2 questions per passage (95% of the time). 20% of the time - 2 questions; 75% of the time - 1 question.
        *   Wording: “What, why, how, According to, Which of the following”. Can be a statement (e.g., “Mollusks are impacted by ocean acidification because”).
        *   90% of the time the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th question, 5% of the time first or last. Sequential order.
    *   **Negative Factual Information:**
        *   40-50% of passages will have one.
        *   Wording: “All of the following are true….EXCEPT” or “Which of the following is NOT mentioned…”.
        *   Mixed up between 1st - 5th question, almost never the first question.
    *   **Author’s Purpose:**
        *   90% of passages have one. 5-10% have 2.
        *   Wording: Almost always “Why does the author mention” (5% of the time being “What is the author’s purpose in mentioning” or “Which of the following best describes the purpose of paragraph X”).
        *   Almost always the 3rd - 5th question.
    *   **Organization:**
        *   20% of passages will have one.
        *   Wording: Always “What is the relationship between…”.
    *   **Insert Text:**
        *   15% of passages will have one.
        *   Usually the last question. Usually located in the 2nd to 4th paragraph.
        *   Wording: Same wording, must add squares to passages (see our own complete tests).
    *   **Inference:**
        *   Included in 60-75% of passages. 1-2 questions when they show up, 80% of the time it’s just one question.
        *   Order: 2nd - 5th question.
        *   Wording: “What can be inferred,” “What is suggested,” - Always includes the word infer or suggest.
    *   **Gist-Content:**
        *   Included in 10-15% of passages.
        *   Almost always the first question.

## Feedback Integration (from .clinerules/toefl-2026.md)
*   **Avoid "for example":** Do not explicitly use the phrase "for example." Just provide the example directly.
*   **No big lists:** Eliminate long lists in both complete and incomplete sentences.
*   **Split missing letters:** If applicable, split missing letters across two sentences. The first sentence can have most, and the second can have missing letters only at the beginning.
*   **Two complete sentences at the end:** Ensure there are two complete sentences after any missing letter sections.
*   **Varied opening sentences:** Do not always use an obvious “xxx is yyy” opening.
*   **Layman's terms vocabulary:** Avoid overly technical vocabulary. Aim for freshman-level university textbook language that a newcomer would understand. The trickiest word in ETS samples was "cognitive."
*   **Avoid proper nouns in later sentences:** The second and third sentences should ideally not use proper nouns.
*   **Concise final sentences:** Avoid long-winded final sentences.
*   **No lists in incomplete sentences:** Ensure sentences with missing letters do not contain lists, as this makes it too difficult for students.
*   **Variety in sentence structure:** Introduce more variety in sentence structure beyond the opening sentence.
