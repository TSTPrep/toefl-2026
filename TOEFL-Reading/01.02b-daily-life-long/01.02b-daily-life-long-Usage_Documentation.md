# 01.02b, TOEFL Reading, Daily Life LONG, Usage Documentation

This document outlines the usage and generation process for the "Daily Life LONG" question type.

## Overview
The "Daily Life LONG" question type focuses on longer passages (130-170 words) that simulate authentic daily communications such as emails, notices, announcements, or advertisements. These passages are followed by three questions, primarily focusing on Gist Purpose, Factual Information, Negative Factual Information, and Inference.

## Generation Process
1.  **Passage Generation:**
    *   Generate passages that are 130-170 words long, with a practical, concise, and informative tone.
    *   Ensure passages mimic authentic daily communication documents (e.g., emails with subject lines, memos, invitations).
    *   Incorporate everyday contexts: workplace, school, events, maintenance, services, facilities, local activities, scheduling changes.
    *   Include practical details such as deadlines, requirements, special offers, instructions, or policies.
    *   Ensure every detail in the passage connects directly to a possible test question.
    *   Avoid academic language; write in layman's terms suitable for a newcomer, while maintaining a freshman-level university textbook standard.
    *   Avoid using "for example" explicitly; just give examples.
    *   Avoid big lists in both intact sentences and sentences with missing letters.

2.  **Question Generation:**
    *   Generate three questions per passage.
    *   **Gist Purpose:**
        *   Include as the first question for 50-60% of texts.
        *   Wording: "What is the main purpose of the (email/this year’s maintenance)?" or "Why did Ms. Rogers send the email to Mr. Suzuki?" (10% of the time).
    *   **Factual Information:**
        *   Include at least one for 90% of texts; two for 40-50% of texts.
        *   Wording: Typically starts with “What, when, why, or how.” Exceptions like “On June 13, residents can expect emails about.”
    *   **Negative Factual Information:**
        *   Include one for 10% of texts (at most one per passage).
        *   Wording: Must include "NOT" or "EXCEPT" in all caps (e.g., "Rebecca Yang's team does NOT include:").
    *   **Inference:**
        *   Include one for 60-70% of texts; one question 60% of the time, two questions 40% of the time.
        *   Wording: Varies, often uses "suggest" or "infer" (e.g., “The email is most likely sent to:”, “What can be inferred about participants of the webinar?”).

3.  **Answer Choices:**
    *   Provide 4 short and clear options for each question.
    *   Distractors should be designed to:
        *   Misinterpret a detail
        *   Overgeneralize
        *   Mix up sender vs. recipient roles
        *   Suggest something plausible in real life but not supported by the passage.

## Feedback Integration (from .clinerules/toefl-2026.md)
*   **Avoid "for example":** Do not explicitly use the phrase "for example." Just provide the example directly.
*   **No big lists:** Eliminate long lists in both complete and incomplete sentences.
*   **Split missing letters:** If applicable, split missing letters across two sentences. The first sentence can have most, and the second can have missing letters only at the beginning.
*   **Two complete sentences at the end:** Ensure there are two complete sentences after any missing letter sections.
*   **Varied opening sentences:** Do not always use an obvious “xxx is yyy” opening.
*   **Layman's terms vocabulary:** Avoid overly technical vocabulary. Aim for freshman-level university textbook language that a newcomer would understand. The trickiest word in ETS samples was "cognitive."
*   **Avoid proper nouns in later sentences:** The second and third sentences should ideally not use proper nouns.
*   **Concise final sentences:** Avoid long-winded final sentences.
*   **No lists in incomplete sentences:** Ensure sentences with missing letters do not contain lists, as this makes it too difficult for students.
*   **Variety in sentence structure:** Introduce more variety in sentence structure beyond the opening sentence.
