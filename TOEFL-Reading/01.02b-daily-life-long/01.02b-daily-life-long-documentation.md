## Passage Characteristics
*   **Length:** 130 - 170 words (most about 150).
*   **Authenticity:** Mimics daily communication (email, notice, announcement, ad, memo, invitation, etc.).
*   **Tone:** Practical, concise, and informative, not academic.
*   **Subject Lines:** Common in emails and memos (e.g., “Subject: Server Maintenance”).
*   **Contexts:** Everyday situations like workplace, school, events, maintenance, services, facilities, local activities, scheduling changes.
*   **Details:** Includes practical information such as deadlines, requirements, special offers, instructions, or policies.
*   **Testable Points:** Every detail should directly connect to a possible test question (dates, responsibilities, offers, restrictions, etc.).
*   **Style:** Write like an authentic document; avoid sounding like a test passage. Mimic actual workplace or campus community communications.
*   **Content Strategy:** Think of realistic emails, notices, or ads encountered in school, work, or community settings. Sprinkle in concrete details that support 3–4 testable points (main idea, detail, inference).

## Question Types
*   **Answer Choices:** 4 options, short and clear. Distractors typically rely on:
    *   Misinterpreting a detail
