(DET) Interactive Reading Gen Sheet
Workload Expectations
Phase 1
10-20 examples to be reviewed by Josh MacPherson and Michael Goodine
Phase 2
Up to 50 examples generated based on feedback from phase one. Examples to be reviewed by Josh MacPherson
Phase 3
Finish up creation. Examples to be reviewed by Josh MacPherson.

*Note that the generations should be in a format where editing is easy and intuitive, especially for the first 10-20.

## Read in Daily Life - Chat GPT Notes (Long) - Link
* 130 - 170 words long (most about 150)
* Authentic daily communication (email, notice, announcement, ad, memo, invitation, etc.).
* The tone is practical, concise, and informative, not academic.
* Subject lines are common in emails and memos (“Subject: Server Maintenance”).
* Everyday contexts: workplace, school, events, maintenance, services, facilities, local activities, scheduling changes.
* Includes practical details: deadlines, requirements, special offers, instructions, or policies.
* Every detail in the passage should connect directly to a possible test question (dates, responsibilities, offers, restrictions, etc.)
* Write like an authentic document (don’t sound like a test passage). Mimic the style of actual workplace or campus community communications.
* Think of emails, notices, or ads you’d realistically encounter in school, work, or community settings, sprinkle in a few concrete details, and ensure they support 3–4 testable points (main idea, detail, inference).
* Answer Choices - 4 options, short and clear. Distractors usually rely on:
   * Misinterpreting a detail
   * Overgeneralizing
   * Mixing up sender vs. recipient roles
   * Suggesting something that could be true in real life but isn’t in the passage
