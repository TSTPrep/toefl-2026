**Update Type**: Moderate - 4 of 10 tips need updates
**Implementation Status**: All 3 phases included (ready for WordPress)

## PHASE 1: 2026 CONTENT UPDATES

### INSERT AT TOP (After headline, before first paragraph)

#### 🎯 **Updated for January 2026 Test Format**

**Good news**: Most of these tips still work perfectly! The fundamentals of great TOEFL speaking haven't changed.

**What DID change on January 21, 2026**: The TOEFL Speaking section was completely redesigned. Instead of 4 tasks (1 independent + 3 integrated), you now have just **2 tasks**:

1. **Listen and Repeat** (~7 sentences) - Test your pronunciation and fluency
2. **Take an Interview** (~4 questions) - Simulate a real conversation

**Total time**: About 8 minutes (down from 16 minutes)

Don't worry - Tips #1-6 below are still 100% relevant. We've updated Tips #7-8 with the new task formats and timing. Let's dive in!

---

## TIPS #1-6: NO CHANGES NEEDED
These tips remain completely relevant:
- Tip #1: Practice instead of watching videos
- Tip #2: Record your voice
- Tip #3: Use a grading rubric to analyze your response
- Tip #4: Find a study buddy
- Tip #5: Move your hands when you speak
- Tip #6: Pick the right time and place when you study

## TIP #7: COMPLETE REPLACEMENT

**REPLACE ENTIRE SECTION** starting from "Speaking Tip #7: Start the same way every time for each question type" through the end of the introductory phrases table.

### Speaking Tip #7: Master the Two New Task Formats

The 2026 TOEFL Speaking has just two tasks, and knowing what to expect is half the battle.

#### Task 1: Listen and Repeat (~7 sentences)

This task tests your **pronunciation, fluency, and pacing**. You'll hear a sentence, get 15 seconds to prepare, then 15 seconds to repeat it as accurately as possible.

**Strategy**:
- Focus on **exact repetition**, not paraphrasing
- Match the speaker's **rhythm and intonation**
- Don't rush - clarity beats speed
- If you mess up a word, keep going smoothly

**Practice approach**:
1. Listen to podcasts or YouTube videos
2. Pause after each sentence
3. Repeat it exactly as spoken
4. Record yourself and compare

**Pro tip**: The sentences get progressively harder. The first 2-3 are warm-ups (simple vocabulary, short length). Sentences 4-7 test complex grammar, longer phrases, and tricky pronunciation.

#### Task 2: Take an Interview (~4 questions)

This simulates a **real conversation** where you answer follow-up questions about a topic. You get **NO prep time** - just 45 seconds to respond to each question.

**Common interview topics**:
- Daily routines and preferences
- Educational experiences
- Work and career plans
- Hobbies and interests
- Problem-solving scenarios

**Sentence starters that work for ANY interview question**:

| Situation | Opening Phrase |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Giving an opinion** | "Personally, I think..." / "From my perspective..." / "To be honest..." |
| **Describing experience** | "In my experience..." / "I remember when..." / "One time..." |
| **Explaining preference** | "I prefer X because..." / "The reason I like X is..." / "X works better for me since..." |
| **Comparing options** | "On one hand... but on the other hand..." / "While X has benefits, Y is..." |
| **Elaborating** | "What I mean is..." / "In other words..." / "For example..." |
| **Handling uncertainty** | "I've never thought about that before, but..." / "That's an interesting question..." / "If I had to choose..." |

**The key difference from the old TOEFL**: This is conversational, not academic. Speak naturally like you're talking to a friend, not reading an essay.

**Practice approach**:
1. Have a friend ask you random questions
2. Answer immediately without planning
3. Speak for 45 seconds non-stop
4. Focus on sounding natural and conversational

---

## TIP #8: MAJOR TIMING UPDATE

**REPLACE THE TIMING DETAILS** in the existing Tip #8 section.

Find the section that currently says:

```
The thing is, for the independent speaking task, you only get:
15 seconds to prepare your response, and
45 seconds to speak for each question

For the integrated speaking tasks, you get:
30 seconds to prepare, and
60 seconds to speak for each question. (for question four you only get 20 seconds to prepare
```

**REPLACE WITH**:

```
The 2026 TOEFL Speaking has completely new timing:

For **Task 1: Listen and Repeat** (×7 sentences):
- You hear the sentence once
- **15 seconds to prepare** (think about pronunciation)
- **15 seconds to speak** (repeat it exactly)

For **Task 2: Take an Interview** (×4 questions):
- **NO prep time** (it's a conversation, not a speech!)
- **45 seconds to speak** per question
- Questions appear one at a time

**Total speaking time**: About 8 minutes (much faster than the old 16-minute format)
```

**Then update the practice instructions**:

**REPLACE**:
```
To practice for an independent speaking task, just follow these 4 simple steps:
Read the speaking prompt
Set your timer for 60 seconds
Spend 15 seconds preparing your response
Spend 45 seconds responding

To practice for an integrated speaking task, follow these 4 steps:
Read and listen to the speaking prompt
Set your timer for 90 seconds (80 seconds for question four)
Spend 30 seconds preparing your response (20 seconds for question four)
Spend 60 seconds responding
```

**WITH**:

```
To practice **Task 1: Listen and Repeat**:
1. Find a sentence online (news article, podcast transcript, YouTube captions)
2. Read it once and set timer for 15 seconds
3. Prepare mentally (don't speak yet)
4. When timer beeps, speak for 15 seconds repeating the sentence

To practice **Task 2: Interview Questions**:
1. Have someone ask you a random question
2. **NO timer for prep** (interviews don't have prep time!)
3. Set timer for 45 seconds and start speaking immediately
4. Focus on natural, conversational delivery

Practice Tip: The hardest part? Task 2 has NO prep time. Train yourself to speak immediately by practicing with random conversation starters every day.
```

---

## TIP #9: NO CHANGES NEEDED
The speech-to-text tip remains completely relevant for pronunciation practice.

---

## TIP #10: NO CHANGES NEEDED
Getting teacher support is still the best way to improve.

---

## UPDATE RUBRIC REFERENCE (Tip #3 area)

Find the line: "Here it is – the actual ETS speaking test rubric"

**ADD IMMEDIATELY AFTER**:

```
**Note for 2026**: ETS updated the scoring rubric to a **5-point scale** for the new task types. The fundamentals are the same (delivery, language use, topic development), but the criteria now reflect conversational fluency rather than structured responses.
```

---

## OPTIONAL: UPDATE INTRODUCTION PARAGRAPH

Find: "Not only do you have to speak to a computer, but you have to remember various aspects of the TOEFL Speaking:"

**CONSIDER REPLACING THE BULLET LIST** with:

```
Task formats (Listen and Repeat vs Interview)
Time management (no prep time for interviews!)
Grading criteria (now on a 5-point scale)
Pronunciation accuracy vs conversational fluency
```

```
The 2026 TOEFL Speaking section has these tasks:
1. Listen and Repeat - Repeat 7 sentences exactly as spoken (15 sec prep, 15 sec speak)

3. Total time: ~8 minutes (down from old 16 minutes)
4. Scoring: 5-point scale based on delivery, language use, and fluency

### Snippet 2: Definition Format
**Question**: "What is the Listen and Repeat task?"
**Answer Format**: Clear definition with context
**Placement**: Tip #7 Task 1 section

```
The Listen and Repeat task tests your pronunciation and fluency by having you repeat 7 sentences exactly as spoken by a native speaker. You have 15 seconds to prepare (think about pronunciation) and 15 seconds to speak your repetition. The sentences get progressively harder, starting with simple vocabulary and ending with complex grammar and fast delivery.
```

**Why This Works**: Definition-style answers in first 2-3 sentences match snippet extraction; longer explanation builds authority

**Question**: "How do I prepare for TOEFL speaking?"
**Answer Format**: Detailed explanation with actionable steps
**Placement**: Tip #1 or practice section

```
Prepare for TOEFL speaking by practicing every day with real strategies instead of just watching videos. Record yourself answering questions for 45 seconds without planning (Task 2 simulation), listen to podcasts and repeat sentences exactly (Task 1 simulation), and use a grading rubric to analyze your responses. Find a study buddy to practice the interview format, move your hands when you speak to improve fluency, and choose a consistent time and quiet place for focused practice.
```

| Total | ~8 minutes | Varies | Varies | 11 total items |
```

**Why This Works**: Tables are Google's preferred format for comparison queries; structured data wins featured snippets 60%+ of the time

### Snippet 5: List Format
**Question**: "What speaking skills does TOEFL test?"
**Answer Format**: Bulleted list with explanations
**Placement**: Tip #3 or rubric section

```
TOEFL 2026 Speaking tests these key skills:
• Pronunciation - Exact repetition and clarity in Listen and Repeat task
