## Updated Article Content

### Introduction

The TOEFL Reading section underwent a complete redesign on January 21, 2026, and time management is now more critical than ever. With only **~27 minutes total** (compared to the old 36 minutes), you'll face **adaptive modules** that adjust difficulty based on your performance.

Here's what changed:
- **Old Format**: 36 minutes, 2 passages, 20 questions, 10 question types
- **New Format**: ~27 minutes, adaptive modules, 35-48 questions, 3 task types

Don't panic! While the format changed, the **core time management principles** still apply. This guide will show you how to adapt proven strategies to the new 2026 format.

---

## Understanding the New Adaptive Format

Before diving into time management rules, you need to understand how **multistage adaptive testing (MST)** works:

### Two-Module System

**Module 1 (Baseline Assessment)**:
- Mix of all 3 task types
- ~11-12 minutes
- Your performance determines Module 2 difficulty

**Module 2 (Adaptive Difficulty)**:
- Adjusts based on Module 1 results
- ~11-12 minutes
- Higher/lower difficulty = higher/lower score potential

### Critical Strategy Insight

**Module 1 accuracy matters most.** It's better to answer fewer questions correctly than rush through and guess. Why? Because:
- ✅ Strong Module 1 → Harder Module 2 → Higher score ceiling
- ❌ Weak Module 1 → Easier Module 2 → Lower score ceiling

Think of Module 1 as setting your "difficulty level" for the entire section.

---

## The Three New Task Types (And How Long Each Takes)

### Task 1: Complete the Words
**What it is**: Fill in missing word halves using context clues
**Passage length**: 70-150 words
**Time per item**: **60-90 seconds**
**Questions**: 8-12 per module

**Time management tip**: These are the fastest tasks. If you're ahead of schedule, don't slow down—bank that extra time for academic passages.

### Task 2: Read in Daily Life
**What it is**: Real-world texts (emails, ads, forms, notices)
**Passage length**: 100-300 words
**Time per passage**: **90-120 seconds**
**Questions**: 10-15 per module

**Time management tip**: Skim for the specific information requested. You don't need to understand everything—just locate what the question asks for.

### Task 3: Read an Academic Passage
**What it is**: Traditional academic reading (science, history, social studies)
**Passage length**: 300-500 words
**Time per question**: **2-3 minutes** (including reading time)
**Questions**: 15-20 per module

**Time management tip**: This is where you'll spend most of your time. Budget carefully and prioritize accuracy over speed.

---

## Rule #1: Take Notes and Circle

**What changed**: Nothing! This strategy works exactly the same way in 2026.

As you read, **underline keywords** and **circle important terms**. Most students don't do this, but it's the difference between re-reading passages multiple times (wasting time) versus finding answers quickly.

### What to Circle in Each Task Type

**Complete the Words**:
- Context clues (words that hint at meaning)
- Transition words (however, therefore, although)
- Grammatical patterns (verb forms, word families)

**Read in Daily Life**:
- Numbers, dates, times
- Names and places
- Action items ("must," "required," "deadline")

**Read an Academic Passage**:
- Main ideas (usually first/last sentences of paragraphs)
- Examples and evidence
- Transition words showing structure
- Definitions and key concepts

### The Circling Technique

Here's how to do it efficiently:
1. **First pass**: Circle as you read (adds only 2-3 seconds per passage)
2. **Question time**: Scan your circles to locate answer quickly
3. **Result**: Save 30-60 seconds per question (massive time savings)

**Example**: If a question asks "What is the professor's main concern?" you've already circled the main idea in paragraph 1. Jump straight there instead of re-reading the entire passage.

---

## Rule #2: Watch the Clock (New Module Strategy!)

In the old format, you could check the clock once every 10 minutes. In the new adaptive format, **you need different timing strategies for each module**.

### Module 1 Timing: Quality Over Speed

**Goal**: Maximize accuracy to unlock higher score potential in Module 2

**Time checkpoints**:
- **3 minutes in**: Should be 20-25% through questions
- **6 minutes in**: Should be 40-50% through questions
- **9 minutes in**: Should be 70-80% through questions
- **11-12 minutes**: Finish with time to review flagged questions

**If you're behind schedule**: SLOW DOWN. Seriously. It's better to accurately answer 30 questions than rush through 35 and miss half of them. Module 1 performance determines your Module 2 difficulty level.

### Module 2 Timing: Adjust Based on Difficulty

**If Module 2 is harder** (congrats, you aced Module 1!):
- Questions take 15-20% longer
- Focus on accuracy over completion
- Budget 2.5-3 minutes per academic passage question

**If Module 2 is easier** (you need to recover):
- Answer as many as possible accurately
- Use your knowledge from Module 1 mistakes
- Budget 2-2.5 minutes per academic passage question

### Clock-Watching Strategy

**Use the on-screen timer strategically**:
1. Check at 3-minute intervals (not constantly)
2. Don't panic if behind—adjust strategy, don't rush
3. In Module 1: Prioritize accuracy over speed
4. In Module 2: Match your pace to difficulty level

---

## Rule #3: Never Skip a Question

**What changed**: This rule is MORE important in 2026 because of adaptive testing.

Every question you skip in **Module 1** potentially affects your Module 2 difficulty. Unanswered questions = automatic wrong = lower Module 2 difficulty = lower score ceiling.

### The Right Way to Handle Difficult Questions

**Old strategy** (still works): Guess and flag for review
**New adaptive twist**: In Module 1, make your best educated guess before moving on

**How to guess intelligently**:

**Complete the Words**:
- Eliminate grammatically impossible options first
- Use word family patterns (noun endings, verb forms)
- Trust your ear—say options aloud mentally

**Read in Daily Life**:
- Scan for mentioned keywords in passage
- Eliminate options with information NOT in the text
- Choose the most literal, specific answer

**Read an Academic Passage**:
- Eliminate extreme language (always, never, only)
- Choose options that paraphrase passage language
- Main idea questions: Broadest option that's still accurate

### The "Flag and Move On" System

Here's the efficient workflow:
1. **First pass**: Read question, scan passage, circle keywords
2. **Can't find answer in 30 seconds?** Flag it
3. **Make your best guess** (critical in Module 1!)
4. **Move to next question**
5. **Return to flagged questions** if time permits at end

**Result**: You maintain forward momentum while maximizing Module 1 accuracy.

---

## Rule #4: Review Your Answers

**What changed**: You have LESS time to review, so you must be strategic about which questions to double-check.

In the old format, you might have 2-3 minutes for review. In 2026, you might have **30-90 seconds**. Use it wisely.

### Priority Review System

**HIGH PRIORITY (Review first)**:
- ✅ Flagged questions you guessed on
- ✅ Complete the Words questions (quick to verify)
- ✅ Questions where you chose between two answers

**MEDIUM PRIORITY (Review if time)**:
- ⚠️ Read in Daily Life scanning questions
- ⚠️ Vocabulary-in-context questions

**LOW PRIORITY (Skip review)**:
- ❌ Questions you felt confident about
- ❌ Main idea questions (usually your first instinct is right)
- ❌ True/False questions where answer was explicit

### The 30-Second Review Technique

When you only have 30-60 seconds left:
1. **Skim your flagged questions** (don't re-read passages)
2. **Check Complete the Words grammar** (say answer aloud mentally)
3. **Verify you clicked your intended answer** (common misclick errors)
4. **Move on** when time expires

**Don't**: Start re-reading entire passages or second-guessing confident answers.

---

## *Bonus Rule: Read and Answer at the Same Time

**What changed**: This strategy is now ESSENTIAL for time management in the shorter test format.

In the old 36-minute test, you could read entire passages first, then answer questions. In the new 23-minute format, you **must** read and answer simultaneously for efficiency.

### How to Read and Answer Simultaneously

**For Complete the Words**:
1. Read the sentence with the blank
2. Mentally predict what word fits
3. Check options for your prediction
4. Choose and move on (10-15 seconds per question)

**For Read in Daily Life**:
1. Skim passage headings and structure (5 seconds)
2. Read the question first
3. Scan passage for the specific information
4. Answer without reading everything (30-45 seconds per question)

**For Read an Academic Passage**:
1. Read the first question
2. Read paragraph 1 (usually contains answer to question 1)
3. Answer question 1
4. Read question 2, then paragraph 2
5. Continue this alternating rhythm

### Why This Works

**Time savings**: 20-30% faster than read-everything-first approach
**Comprehension**: Better focus on relevant information
**Fatigue**: Less mental load, more energy for Module 2

### Example in Action

**Old approach** (36 minutes available):
- Read entire 700-word passage: 3-4 minutes
- Answer 10 questions: 6-7 minutes
- Total: 9-11 minutes per passage

**New approach** (27 minutes total):
- Read and answer simultaneously: 7-9 minutes for academic passages
- Complete the Words/Daily Life: 4-6 minutes
- Total: Better time distribution across all task types

---

## Putting It All Together: Sample Time Management Plan

Here's exactly how to manage your 27 minutes:

### Module 1 (11-12 minutes)

**Minutes 0-4**: Complete the Words (8-12 questions)
- Read sentence, predict word, choose answer
- Circle context clues as you go
- Average 30-45 seconds per question
- **Goal**: 100% accuracy (these are your "easy points")

**Minutes 4-7**: Read in Daily Life (5-8 passages)
- Skim headings, read question first, scan for answer
- Circle keywords (dates, names, requirements)
- Average 30-45 seconds per question
- **Goal**: Quick, accurate scanning (don't read everything)

**Minutes 7-11**: Read an Academic Passage (3-5 passages)
- Read question 1, then paragraph 1, answer immediately
- Continue alternating reading and answering
- Circle main ideas and transitions
- Average 2-3 minutes per question
- **Goal**: Accuracy over completion

**Minutes 11-12**: Review
- Check flagged questions
- Verify Complete the Words grammar
- Ensure no blank answers

### Module 2 (11-12 minutes)

**Approach depends on Module 1 performance**:

**If Module 2 is harder**:
- Slow down on academic passages (2.5-3 minutes per question)
- Maintain Complete the Words accuracy
- Accept that completion might not happen—accuracy is the goal

**If Module 2 is easier**:
- Speed up slightly while maintaining Module 1 accuracy
- Use mistakes as learning opportunities
- Complete as many questions as possible

## Common Time Management Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake #1: Rushing Through Module 1

**Why it's bad**: Poor Module 1 performance = easier Module 2 = lower score ceiling
**Fix**: Quality over speed in Module 1—accuracy determines your potential

### Mistake #2: Reading Everything Carefully

**Why it's bad**: You'll run out of time before finishing
**Fix**: Read and answer simultaneously, especially for Daily Life texts

### Mistake #3: Not Using the Flagging Feature

**Why it's bad**: You waste time re-searching for questions you wanted to review
**Fix**: Flag immediately when uncertain, return if time permits

### Mistake #4: Panicking About the Clock

**Why it's bad**: Anxiety slows thinking and reduces accuracy
**Fix**: Check clock at 3-minute intervals, not constantly. Stay calm and strategic.

### Mistake #5: Leaving Questions Blank

**Why it's bad**: In adaptive testing, blank = wrong, which affects Module 2 difficulty
**Fix**: Always guess intelligently before moving on, even if you flag for review

---

## Practice Exercise: Time Yourself

Want to test your time management? Here's a practice drill:

**Set a timer for 11 minutes** and complete:
- 10 Complete the Words questions (target: 5-7 minutes)
- 5 Read in Daily Life questions (target: 3-4 minutes)
- 3 Academic passage questions (target: 6-8 minutes)

**After your practice**:
- Did you finish in time?
- Which task type took longest?
- Where can you improve efficiency?

Adjust your strategy based on your results. The goal is **consistent accuracy within the time limit**, not necessarily completing every question.

---

## In Conclusion

Time management for the 2026 TOEFL Reading section requires a different approach than the old format. The **adaptive modules** mean Module 1 accuracy is critical, and the **shorter 23-minute time limit** demands efficient strategies.

**Remember the key principles**:
1. ✅ Circle keywords and take notes as you read
2. ✅ Watch the clock strategically (quality over speed in Module 1)
3. ✅ Never skip questions (especially in Module 1)
4. ✅ Review strategically (flagged questions first)
5. ✅ Read and answer simultaneously (essential for time savings)

The good news? With practice, these strategies become automatic. You'll find yourself naturally circling keywords, efficiently scanning Daily Life texts, and pacing yourself through academic passages.

**Practice with the new timing** using official 2026 materials, and you'll walk into test day confident you can handle the 23-minute challenge.

### Featured Snippet Answer Blocks

**Snippet Block 1: List Format**
**Question**: "Why is Module 1 accuracy important in the 2026 TOEFL Reading?"

Module 1 accuracy is critical in the 2026 TOEFL Reading section because:
1. **Determines Module 2 Difficulty**: Your Module 1 performance adjusts the difficulty level of Module 2
2. **Sets Score Ceiling**: Strong Module 1 accuracy = harder Module 2 = higher score potential
3. **Affects Overall Performance**: Module 1 effectiveness directly impacts your final reading score
4. **Requires Strategic Patience**: It's better to accurately answer 30 questions than rush through 40 and miss half

---

**Snippet Block 2: Paragraph Format**
**Question**: "How much time do you have for the TOEFL Reading section in 2026?"

The 2026 TOEFL Reading section provides approximately 27 minutes total, split evenly between two adaptive modules. Module 1 takes about 13-14 minutes and establishes your baseline performance level. Module 2 also takes approximately 13-14 minutes but adapts in difficulty based on your Module 1 results. This 27-minute total (down from the previous 36 minutes) makes time management essential and prioritizes accuracy over completion.

---

**Snippet Block 3: Definition Format**
**Question**: "What is adaptive testing in the 2026 TOEFL?"

Adaptive testing (multistage adaptive testing or MST) is an assessment approach where test difficulty adjusts based on your performance. In the 2026 TOEFL Reading section, your Module 1 performance determines whether Module 2 will present easier or harder questions. This system aims to identify your true ability level more efficiently than traditional fixed-difficulty tests, potentially allowing ETS to provide more accurate scoring with fewer questions.
