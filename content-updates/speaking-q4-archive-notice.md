## Updated Introduction Section

**Add after archive notice, before existing content:**

### What Was Speaking Question 4?

In the pre-2026 TOEFL format, Speaking Question 4 was an **academic listening task** that required you to:
1. Listen to an academic lecture (90-120 seconds)
2. Summarize the lecture, including the main concept, definition, and supporting examples (20 seconds prep, 60 seconds response)

**This task tested:** Academic listening comprehension, note-taking, summarization, and ability to explain complex concepts clearly.

**Transferable skills from this guide:**
- ✅ Strategic note structure (Tip #1) - Valuable for organizing any response
- ✅ Identifying topic definitions and examples (Tip #2) - Core academic skill
- ✅ Using transitional phrases (Tip #3) - Makes any response clearer
- ✅ Clear explanatory delivery (Tip #4) - Universal speaking skill
