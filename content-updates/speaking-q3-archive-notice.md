## Updated Introduction Section

**Add after archive notice, before existing content:**

### What Was Speaking Question 3?

In the pre-2026 TOEFL format, Speaking Question 3 was an **integrated listening task** that required you to:
1. Listen to a conversation between two students (~60-90 seconds)
2. Summarize the conversation, including the problem and proposed solutions (60 seconds prep, 60 seconds response)

**This task tested:** Listening comprehension, note-taking, summarization, and speaking fluency in a casual context.

**Transferable skills from this guide:**
- ✅ Professional note-taking strategies (Tip #1) - Critical for new listening-based tasks
- ✅ Using casual, natural language (Tip #2) - Valuable for the new Interview task
- ✅ Response planning under time pressure (Tip #3) - Universal speaking skill
- ✅ Following response templates (Tip #4) - Adaptable to 2026 formats
