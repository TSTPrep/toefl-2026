## Updated Introduction Section

**Add after archive notice, before existing content:**

### What Was Speaking Question 2?

In the pre-2026 TOEFL format, Speaking Question 2 was an **integrated task** that required you to:
1. Read a short campus announcement (45-50 seconds)
2. Listen to a student conversation discussing the announcement (~60-80 seconds)
3. Summarize both the announcement and the student's opinion (60 seconds prep, 60 seconds response)

**This task tested:** Reading comprehension, listening comprehension, note-taking, and synthesis skills.

**Transferable skills from this guide:**
- ✅ Note-taking strategies (Tip #1) - Still valuable for new listening-based tasks
- ✅ Identifying main points and counterpoints (Tip #2) - Useful for any comprehension task
- ✅ Response planning and organization (Tip #3) - Universal speaking skill
- ✅ Clear delivery techniques (Tip #4) - Essential for both 2026 tasks
- ✅ Template usage for structure (Tip #6) - Adaptable to new formats
