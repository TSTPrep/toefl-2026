## TASK 1 - BUILD A SENTENCE (NEW TASK TYPE)

### Introduction to Build a Sentence

"Great news – this task is all about showing you can construct grammatically correct English sentences! You'll see a short paragraph with one sentence missing. Your job is to build a complete, accurate sentence using the words provided.

Think of it like a grammar puzzle: you've got all the pieces, you just need to put them in the right order with the right verb forms, articles, and punctuation.

**Time**: About 8-10 minutes for multiple sentences
**Word count**: One complete sentence per item (usually 8-15 words)
**What it tests**: Grammar, word order, sentence structure"

### Here's a breakdown of Task 1: Build a Sentence

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Format | Short paragraph with missing sentence |
| Your task | Arrange given words into grammatically correct sentence |
| Skills tested | Grammar, syntax, verb tense, articles, word order |
| Time per item | 60-90 seconds |
| Strategy | Read context → Identify sentence pattern → Check grammar |

---

### Tip #1: Know Your Basic Sentence Patterns

"Don't panic when you see the word jumble! Most English sentences follow a few basic patterns, and recognizing them quickly will save you time.

**The Big Three Patterns:**

1. **Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)**: "Students study grammar"
2. **Subject-Verb (SV)**: "The test begins"
3. **Compound**: "Students study grammar, and teachers provide feedback"

**What to look for:**
- WHO or WHAT is doing something? → That's your subject
- What action is happening? → That's your verb
- What receives the action? → That's your object

**Example:**
Given words: `research / valuable / provides / the / insights`
- Subject: "the research" (article + noun)
- Verb: "provides"
- Object: "valuable insights" (adjective + noun)
- **Answer**: "The research provides valuable insights."

Pro tip: Start by identifying the verb – it's the engine of the sentence!"

---

### Tip #2: Watch for Common Grammar Traps

"The TOEFL isn't trying to trick you with impossible grammar – but they WILL test the stuff that English learners commonly get wrong. Here are the top traps to avoid:

**Subject-Verb Agreement**
- ❌ "The students studies"
- ✅ "The students study" (plural subject needs plural verb)

**Verb Tense Consistency**
- ❌ "Yesterday, she goes to class"
- ✅ "Yesterday, she went to class" (past time marker needs past tense)

**Articles (a, an, the)**
- ❌ "Student asked question"
- ✅ "The student asked a question" (specific student, general question)

**Prepositions in Fixed Phrases**
- ❌ "depend from" / ✅ "depend on"
- ❌ "interested for" / ✅ "interested in"

**Word Order in Questions vs Statements**
- ❌ "How works this?"
- ✅ "How does this work?"

Practice tip: When building your sentence, say it out loud in your head. If it sounds wrong, it probably is!"

---

### Tip #3: Read the Full Context Before Building

"Here's a secret: the TOEFL gives you clues! The sentences before and after the blank will tell you:

**Tense clues:**
- "Yesterday, researchers conducted experiments. _____ [missing sentence] _____ The results showed interesting patterns."
- Context clue: Past tense verbs ("conducted," "showed") → your sentence should use past tense too!

**Subject clues:**
- "Marine biology focuses on ocean ecosystems. _____ [missing sentence] _____ It requires extensive training."
- Context clue: "It" in the next sentence → your sentence should have a singular subject

**Transition clues:**
- "However," "Therefore," "Additionally" in surrounding sentences tell you if your sentence should contrast, conclude, or add information.

**Strategy:**
1. Read the paragraph first (10 seconds)
2. Identify: What topic? What tense? What's the logical flow?
3. Build your sentence to fit seamlessly into the context
4. Read the whole paragraph WITH your sentence to make sure it flows

Don't build in isolation – make your sentence a good neighbor!"

---

## TASK 2 - WRITE AN EMAIL (NEW TASK TYPE)

### Introduction to Write an Email

"This is the most practical task on the entire TOEFL! You'll write a real-world email in a situation you might actually encounter: asking a professor for an extension, requesting information about housing, or responding to a campus announcement.

The best part? It's short and focused – just 100-150 words. That's about the length of two text messages!

**Time**: About 10-12 minutes
**Word count**: 100-150 words (quality over quantity!)
**What it tests**: Practical communication, appropriate tone, clear organization"

### Here's a breakdown of Task 2: Write an Email

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Format | Email prompt with scenario and recipient |
| Your task | Write appropriate email response (100-150 words) |
| Skills tested | Tone, organization, clarity, purpose |
| Time | 10-12 minutes |
| Strategy | Greeting → Purpose → Details → Closing |

---

### Tip #4: Use Appropriate Email Formality

"Here's the thing about emails: the right tone matters as much as the right words. Writing 'Hey dude!' to a professor will sink your score, even if the rest is perfect.

**Formal vs Informal: Quick Guide**

**Formal situations** (professors, administrators, landlords):
- Greeting: "Dear Professor Smith," or "Dear Dr. Johnson,"
- Closing: "Sincerely," or "Best regards," or "Thank you,"
- Tone: Respectful, clear, complete sentences

**Semi-formal situations** (classmates, roommates, student services):
- Greeting: "Hi Maria," or "Hello,"
- Closing: "Thanks," or "Best," or "See you soon,"
- Tone: Friendly but professional

**Red flags to avoid:**
- ❌ "Hey" or "Yo" for anyone
- ❌ Slang ("gonna," "wanna," "ASAP")
- ❌ All caps or excessive punctuation!!!
- ❌ Emojis (seriously, none)
- ❌ Text message language ("u" instead of "you")

**Golden rule**: When in doubt, go slightly more formal. Better to be overly polite than too casual!

**Example openings:**
- ✅ "Dear Professor Martinez, I am writing to request..." (formal)
- ✅ "Hi Sarah, I hope this email finds you well..." (semi-formal)
- ❌ "Hey Prof, What's up?" (too casual)"

---

### Tip #5: Structure Matters – Follow the Four-Part Formula

"Don't just start typing and hope for the best! Every good email follows a simple structure, and the TOEFL graders are looking for it.

**The Four-Part Email Formula:**

**1. Greeting** (1 line)
- "Dear Professor Chen," or "Hi Marcus,"

**2. Purpose statement** (1-2 sentences)
- Get straight to the point: WHY are you writing?
- "I am writing to request an extension on the research paper deadline."
- "I would like to ask about the housing options for international students."

**3. Details/Explanation** (2-4 sentences)
- Provide necessary context or details
- Be specific but concise
- Use transition words: "Specifically," "Additionally," "Unfortunately,"

**4. Closing** (1-2 sentences)
- Express appreciation or next steps
- End with appropriate sign-off
- "Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your response."
- "I appreciate your help with this matter."

**Example structure in action (145 words):**

```
Dear Professor Martinez,

I am writing to request a two-day extension for the final research paper due on Friday, March 15th.

Unfortunately, I have been dealing with a family emergency that required me to travel home unexpectedly last weekend. This situation prevented me from accessing the library resources I need to complete the analysis section of my paper. I have completed approximately 80% of the work and only need two additional days to finish the remaining sections and properly cite my sources.

I understand this is short notice, and I apologize for any inconvenience. I am committed to submitting high-quality work and would greatly appreciate your consideration of this request.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
Alex Thompson
```

Notice how each part flows naturally to the next? That's what you're aiming for!"

---

### Tip #6: Time Management – 7-10 Minutes Is Plenty

"Here's a time breakdown that works:

**Minute 1-2: Plan**
- Read the prompt carefully
- Identify: Who's the recipient? What's the situation? What's your goal?
- Mentally outline: Greeting → Purpose → 2-3 key details → Closing

**Minutes 3-8: Write**
- Follow your four-part structure
- Don't overthink – write naturally
- Aim for 120-140 words (leaves room for editing)
- Use transition words to connect ideas

**Minutes 9-10: Edit**
- Check spelling (no spellcheck!)
- Verify tone is appropriate
- Make sure you addressed all parts of the prompt
- Fix any obvious grammar errors

**Pro strategy**: Don't spend time counting words obsessively. If you write a greeting + purpose + 3-4 detail sentences + closing, you'll naturally hit 100-150 words.

**What to do if you have extra time:**
- DON'T add fluff! Quality > quantity
- DO check for common mistakes: subject-verb agreement, verb tense, articles
- DO verify you used an appropriate greeting and closing"

---

## TASK 3 - JOIN A DISCUSSION (PRESERVED TASK - FORMERLY "ACADEMIC DISCUSSION")

### Introduction to Join a Discussion

"Good news! If you've studied TOEFL before, you already know this task – it's the Academic Discussion question that's been around. A professor posts a question, two students respond, and you add your own contribution to the discussion.

**Time**: About 10 minutes
**Word count**: 100-150 words
**What it tests**: Academic discourse, critical thinking, adding value to a conversation"

### Here's a breakdown of Task 3: Join a Discussion

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Format | Professor question + 2 student responses |
| Your task | Add meaningful contribution (100-150 words) |
| Skills tested | Academic reasoning, adding new ideas, discourse markers |
| Time | ~10 minutes |
| Strategy | Read all posts → Identify gap → Add value → Connect ideas |

---

### Tip #7: Add to the Discussion, Don't Repeat

"This is the #1 mistake students make: they read what Andrew and Claire wrote, then basically say the same things in different words. That gets you ZERO points for content!

**What 'adding to the discussion' means:**

❌ **Bad (Repeating):**
- "I agree with Andrew that technology is important in education..."
- Then proceeding to just restate Andrew's exact points

✅ **Good (Adding Value):**
- "While Andrew makes a valid point about technology, I'd like to add another perspective..."
- Then introducing a NEW angle, example, or consideration

**Three ways to genuinely add value:**

**1. Provide a different perspective or angle**
- "Both students focused on benefits, but we should also consider potential drawbacks..."
- "Andrew discussed urban areas, but rural contexts present different challenges..."

**2. Add a specific example or evidence**
- "Research from Stanford University shows that..."
- "In my home country, we implemented a similar policy with surprising results..."

**3. Synthesize and extend**
- "Building on Claire's point about cost, we should also examine long-term economic impacts..."
- "Both perspectives are valid, but there's a third factor neither mentioned: cultural context..."

**Formula that works:**
1. Brief acknowledgment (1 sentence): "While [Student A] and [Student B] make valid points about X..."
2. Your NEW angle (introduce it clearly): "However, I believe we should also consider Y..."
3. Development (2-3 sentences): Explain your point with reasoning or examples
4. Connection back (1 sentence): "This perspective complements the earlier discussion by..."

**Example:**
```
While Emily and Carlos both emphasize the economic benefits of renewable energy, I'd like to address an equally important aspect: technological readiness. Many developing nations lack the infrastructure to support large-scale solar or wind projects. For instance, my home country invested heavily in wind farms, but insufficient power grid capacity meant much of the generated energy was wasted. Therefore, before implementing renewable solutions, countries must first assess and upgrade their existing infrastructure. This practical consideration adds another dimension to the discussion about global energy transition.
```

See how this ADDS to the conversation instead of repeating? That's what graders want to see!"

---

### Tip #8: Stick to 2-3 Simple Verb Tenses

"Academic writing doesn't mean complicated grammar! In fact, using too many verb tenses will slow you down and increase error risk.

**The three tenses you actually need:**

**1. Present simple** (for general truths, current facts)
- "Technology plays an important role..."
- "Studies show that..."
- "This issue affects millions of people..."

**2. Past simple** (for examples, historical references)
- "Researchers discovered..."
- "In 2020, the policy was implemented..."
- "I experienced this firsthand when..."

**3. Present perfect** (to connect past to present - use sparingly!)
- "Recent developments have changed..."
- "Scientists have discovered..."

**What to AVOID:**
- ❌ Future perfect progressive: "They will have been studying..."
- ❌ Past perfect: "She had been thinking..." (unless absolutely necessary for timeline)
- ❌ Complex conditional: "If they would have done..."

**Golden rule**: If you can express your idea in present or past simple, do that! Don't use complex tenses just to sound sophisticated – clarity and accuracy matter more.

**Example of good tense usage (only 2 tenses needed):**

```
While both students focus on immediate benefits, long-term sustainability requires [present] careful consideration. In my community, leaders implemented [past] a similar initiative last year. The initial results were [past] promising, but unexpected challenges emerged [past] after six months. This experience demonstrates [present] that comprehensive planning is [present] essential for success. Therefore, I believe [present] we must [present] examine both short-term and long-term implications.
```

See? Past simple for examples, present simple for arguments. Keep it simple and accurate!"

---

### Tip #9: Include Multiple Sentences with More than One Clause

"This tip is about showing sentence variety and sophistication – without getting too fancy!

**What does 'more than one clause' mean?**

**Simple sentence** (ONE clause):
- "Technology is important."
- (One subject + one verb = one clause)

**Complex/compound sentence** (MULTIPLE clauses):
- "Technology is important **because it facilitates communication**." (two clauses connected)
- "Technology is important, **and it continues to evolve rapidly**." (two clauses connected)

**Why it matters:**
- Shows you can express complex relationships between ideas
- Demonstrates language sophistication
- Makes your writing more engaging and natural

**Easy ways to add clauses:**

**1. Use common subordinators:**
- because, although, while, since, when, if, unless
- "I support this approach **because** research demonstrates its effectiveness."

**2. Use coordinating conjunctions:**
- and, but, so, or
- "The policy has merit, **but** implementation challenges must be addressed."

**3. Use relative clauses:**
- who, which, that, where
- "The study **that** was conducted last year revealed surprising results."

**What good variety looks like (3 sentences, all multi-clause):**

```
While technology offers many benefits, we must also consider potential drawbacks [compound].
Research that was conducted in multiple countries shows mixed results [complex with relative clause].
Some communities benefited significantly, but others faced unexpected challenges [compound].
```

**Pro tip**: Don't force it! It's okay to have some simple sentences mixed in. Aim for 2-3 multi-clause sentences out of 5-7 total sentences. Natural writing with variety beats forced complexity every time!"

---

### Tip #10: Take the Time to Edit – There's No Spellcheck!

"In the real world, you have autocorrect. On the TOEFL? You're on your own! That's why editing is NON-NEGOTIABLE.

**The 60-Second Edit Checklist:**

**Seconds 1-15: Spelling scan**
- Read through quickly looking for obvious spelling errors
- Pay special attention to words you commonly misspell
- Check: their/there/they're, affect/effect, your/you're

**Seconds 16-30: Grammar check**
- Subject-verb agreement: "The students IS" → should be "ARE"
- Verb tense consistency: Did you stick to present/past?
- Articles: "Student asked question" → need "The" and "a"

**Seconds 31-45: Structure verification**
- Did you actually respond to the professor's question?
- Did you add something NEW to the discussion?
- Do you have a clear point, not just rambling?

**Seconds 46-60: Final polish**
- Check word count (100-150 words)
- Verify you have transition words connecting ideas
- Make sure first and last sentences are strong

**Common errors to catch:**

❌ "This is a very important topic that effect many people."
✅ "This is a very important topic that **affects** many people."

❌ "I agree with both student opinion..."
✅ "I agree with both **students' opinions**..."

❌ "In my country, technology have changed education."
✅ "In my country, technology **has** changed education."

**Pro strategy**: Train yourself to edit BACKWARDS (read last sentence first, then second-to-last, etc.). This prevents your brain from auto-correcting errors because it can't anticipate what comes next. You'll catch more mistakes this way!

**Time allocation:**
- Writing: 8 minutes
- Editing: 1-2 minutes
- DON'T skip the edit! Typos and basic grammar errors will lower your score even if your ideas are brilliant."

---

## CONCLUSION - UPDATED

### Original Conclusion (MODIFY)

"The TOEFL writing section can feel overwhelming, but with the right strategies, you can approach it confidently!

**Remember the key changes for 2026:**
- **Three new task types**: Build a Sentence (grammar), Write an Email (practical), Join a Discussion (academic)
- **Shorter time**: ~34 minutes total (much better than the old 50 minutes!)
- **Practical focus**: More real-world writing skills, less essay pressure

**Your action plan:**

1. **For Build a Sentence**: Practice identifying sentence patterns and common grammar traps. Read full contexts before building.

2. **For Write an Email**: Master the four-part structure (greeting → purpose → details → closing) and practice appropriate formality levels.

3. **For Join a Discussion**: Focus on adding NEW ideas to the conversation. Use 2-3 simple verb tenses, include sentence variety, and always edit your work.

**Practice tip**: The most important thing? Practice each task type separately first, then put them together in full practice tests. This builds confidence for test day.

Good luck! You've got this!

**Question**: "How should I structure a TOEFL email?"
**Answer Block**:
The most effective TOEFL email structure follows a simple four-part formula. Begin with an appropriate greeting that matches the recipient (formal "Dear Professor" or semi-formal "Hi Sarah"). Follow with a clear purpose statement (1-2 sentences) that directly explains why you're writing. Then provide specific details and context (2-4 sentences) with relevant information. Finally, close with appreciation or next steps (1-2 sentences) and an appropriate sign-off. This structure ensures your email is well-organized, appropriately formal, and complete – all factors that contribute to a strong writing score. The entire email should be 100-150 words, which is naturally achieved through this four-part approach without forced padding.

### Snippet 5: How-To Format
**Question**: "How do I add value to a TOEFL discussion without repeating?"
**Answer Block**:
To add genuine value to a TOEFL academic discussion:

1. **Acknowledge existing perspectives** (1 sentence): "While Emily and Carlos both emphasize the economic benefits..."

2. **Introduce your new angle** (1 sentence): "However, I believe we should also consider technological readiness..."

3. **Develop your unique contribution** (2-3 sentences): Explain your point with specific reasoning, examples, or evidence from your experience or research

4. **Connect back to the discussion** (1 sentence): "This practical consideration adds another dimension to the discussion about..."

The key is identifying a gap or perspective the other students didn't mention – whether that's a different angle, specific example, or synthesis of their ideas. This approach ensures your contribution genuinely advances the conversation rather than just repeating what's already been said.
