### ⚠️ **Important Update: TOEFL Changed on January 21, 2026**

If you're planning to take the TOEFL, you need to know about some major changes that went into effect on **January 21, 2026**. ETS (the company that makes the TOEFL) rolled out the biggest update to the test in over a decade.

**Here's what changed:**

**New Section Order**: The test now goes Reading → Listening → **Writing** → Speaking (Writing moved before Speaking)

**Adaptive Testing**: The Reading and Listening sections now adjust difficulty based on how you perform. Think of it like a video game that gets harder or easier depending on your skill level. You'll complete Module 1, then Module 2 will adapt to match your ability.

**New Task Types**: All four sections have completely new question formats. For example:
- Reading now includes "Complete the Words" (filling in missing word halves)
- Speaking is just 2 tasks now (down from 4) - "Listen and Repeat" and "Take an Interview"
- Writing has 3 tasks including writing emails and building sentences

**New Scoring System**: Instead of the old 0-30 scale per section, you now get a 1-6 band score (in half-point increments like 4.5, 5.0, 5.5). This aligns better with international standards (CEFR levels).

**Good news?** The test is now approximately 85-90 minutes, which is significantly shorter than the old 120-minute format.

**Don't panic!** The information below still applies - you just need to know that the specific question types and strategies have evolved. We've updated all our articles and practice materials for the 2026 format, so you're in good hands.

Alright, now let's get to your beginner questions...

### UPDATES TO EXISTING CONTENT

#### Question 4: "How is the TOEFL structured?"

**REPLACE THIS**:
```
The TOEFL exam is structured into 4 sections:
Reading
Listening
Speaking
Writing

The Reading section takes 36 minutes; the Listening section takes approximately 36 minutes as well. There used to be a break in the middle of the test, but as of July 26, 2023, there is no longer any break during the TOEFL test. The Speaking section takes between 16 minutes and the Writing section takes about 30 minutes to complete.
```

**WITH THIS**:
```
The TOEFL exam is structured into 4 sections:
Reading
Listening
Writing (moved before Speaking in 2026)
Speaking

**Important:** As of January 21, 2026, the test structure changed significantly. Here's the current timing:

- **Reading section**: ~27 minutes (adaptive - Module 1 + Module 2)
- **Listening section**: ~27 minutes (adaptive - Module 1 + Module 2)
- **Writing section**: ~23 minutes (3 tasks: Build a Sentence, Write an Email, Academic Discussion)
- **Speaking section**: ~8 minutes (2 tasks: Listen and Repeat, Take an Interview)

**Total test time**: Approximately 85-90 minutes with no break.

The big change? Reading and Listening now use **adaptive testing** - Module 1 determines how hard Module 2 will be. If you do well on Module 1, you'll get harder questions in Module 2 (which is actually good for your score!).
```

#### Question 5: "How are the TOEFL tests scored?"

**ADD AFTER EXISTING PARAGRAPH**:
```
**Update for 2026:** Starting January 21, 2026, TOEFL introduced a new scoring system using **1-6 band scores** in half-point increments (like 4.5, 5.0, 5.5). This aligns with the CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference) levels that many international students are already familiar with.

Each section still gets its own score, plus you receive an overall band score. Most universities now require:
- **Undergraduate programs**: 4.0-4.5 overall (B2-C1 level)
- **Graduate programs**: 4.5-5.0 overall (C1 level)
- **Professional programs**: 5.0+ (C1-C2 level)

The old 0-120 scale scores are being phased out, though ETS provides conversion tables for comparison.
```

#### Question 6: "How good does my English have to be to pass the TOEFL?"

**UPDATE THE SCORE CONVERSION TABLE**:
Add a note above the table:
```
**Note**: This table reflects pre-2026 scoring. For tests taken after January 21, 2026, the TOEFL uses a 1-6 band scale aligned with CEFR levels. Contact your target university to confirm their specific requirements for the new format.
```

}
```

**Implementation in WordPress**:
- Copy JSON-LD schemas above
- Paste into Yoast SEO → Snippets section OR
- Use Header/Footer Injection plugin to add to page header

### Component 5: Keyword Optimization Strategy (5 minutes)

**Primary Keywords** (target these heavily):
- "TOEFL beginner's guide"
- "TOEFL 2026 format changes"
- "what is the TOEFL test"
- "TOEFL test structure"
- "TOEFL scoring 2026"

**Secondary Keywords** (target naturally):
- "TOEFL for beginners"
- "TOEFL test preparation"
- "TOEFL adaptive testing"
- "TOEFL band scores"
- "TOEFL 2026 updates"

**Long-Tail Keywords** (work into content):
- "how long is the TOEFL test"
- "what are the TOEFL sections"
- "how are TOEFL tests scored"
- "TOEFL speaking and listening adaptive"
- "new TOEFL task types 2026"

**Implementation**: Naturally distribute keywords throughout Phase 1 content (already done in new sections) and ensure:
- Primary keyword in H1 tag
- 2-3 primary keywords in article body
- 1-2 secondary keywords per section
- Long-tail keywords in Phase 1 update sections

### Component 6: Cannibalization Prevention (2 minutes)

**Beginner's Guide Article Position**: PRIMARY HUB for all 12 articles

**Related Articles This Cannibalize Search Intent**:
- Speaking Tips (more specific, but referenced from Beginner's Guide)
- Reading Tips (more specific, but referenced from Beginner's Guide)
- Listening Tips (more specific, but referenced from Beginner's Guide)
- Writing Tips (more specific, but referenced from Beginner's Guide)

**Cannibalization Prevention Strategy**:
- Beginner's Guide: Focus on "what is TOEFL", "structure", "scoring", "new format overview"
- Specific section guides: Focus on "how to improve at [section]", "strategies for [section]"
- Internal linking: Beginner's Guide LINKS TO section guides for specific help
- Keyword strategy: Beginner's Guide uses general keywords; section guides use specific keywords
- Result: Clear content hierarchy; no keyword overlap

**Prevention Checklist**:
- [ ] Beginner's Guide focuses on breadth (all sections overview)
- [ ] Section guides focus on depth (specific section mastery)
- [ ] Links flow from general → specific
- [ ] Keywords don't duplicate across articles

## NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

**Brand Voice**: Maintain conversational, reassuring tone from original article ("Don't panic!", "you're in good hands")

**Link Strategy**: Only use verified existing URLs from TST Prep sitemap - NO hallucinated links

**Surgical Approach**: This is an UPDATE, not a complete rewrite. Phase 1 content is surgical insertions to existing article flow.

**E-E-A-T Placement**: Credentials should feel natural before content begins; YMYL disclaimer must be in footer (legal compliance)

**SEO Optimization**: 2026 keyword focus (add "2026" to primary keywords) while preserving existing authority and backlinks

**Time Investment Total**: 48 minutes
- Phase 1 (2026 Updates): 5-8 minutes
- Phase 2 (E-E-A-T): 8-10 minutes
