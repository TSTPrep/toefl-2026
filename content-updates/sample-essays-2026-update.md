## Updated Article Content

### Introduction

The TOEFL Writing section underwent a complete redesign on January 21, 2026, introducing **new task types** that test different writing skills:

**What Changed**:
- **Old Format**: 2 tasks (Integrated, Independent) in 50 minutes
- **New Format**: 4 tasks (Build a Sentence, Email, Integrated, Academic Discussion) in 29 minutes

**The 4 New Writing Tasks**:
1. **Build a Sentence** (~2 minutes) - Create grammatically correct sentences from given words
2. **Write an Email** (~10 minutes) - Compose professional/academic emails (100-150 words)
3. **Integrated Writing** (~9 minutes) - Read + Listen + Summarize (400+ words, up from 300)
4. **Academic Discussion** (~10 minutes) - Contribute to discussion board (100 words, replaces Independent)

**Why Sample Essays Help**: Seeing high-scoring responses shows you the structure, tone, vocabulary, and depth needed for each task type. Use these samples as **models**, not templates to memorize—the 2026 TOEFL rewards authentic, personal responses.

This guide provides:
- ✅ Sample responses for all 4 task types
- ✅ Scoring explanations (why each earns high scores)
- ✅ Task-specific strategies and templates
- ✅ Common mistakes to avoid

---

## Task 1: Build a Sentence Sample Responses

### What is Build a Sentence?

**Format**: You receive 3-5 words and must create a grammatically correct, contextually appropriate sentence using those words.

**Time**: ~20-30 seconds per sentence, ~2 minutes total
**Questions**: 5-8 sentences to build
**Scoring**: Correct grammar, appropriate word order, natural phrasing

**Example Prompt**:
> **Given words**: researchers / experiment / laboratory / conducted

### Sample Response 1

**Your sentence**: "The researchers conducted a controlled experiment in the laboratory."

**Why this scores well**:
- ✅ Uses all required words correctly
- ✅ Grammatically perfect (subject-verb-object structure)
- ✅ Natural phrasing ("controlled experiment" is a common collocation)
- ✅ Appropriate article usage ("a" before "controlled")
- ✅ Contextually appropriate (laboratories are where experiments happen)

**Alternative versions** (also high-scoring):
- "Researchers conducted the experiment in a modern laboratory."
- "In the laboratory, researchers conducted a groundbreaking experiment."
- "The laboratory experiment was conducted by experienced researchers."

---

### Sample Response 2

**Given words**: theory / scientists / propose / explain

**Your sentence**: "Scientists propose this theory to explain the observed phenomenon."

**Why this scores well**:
- ✅ Natural word order (subject-verb-object-infinitive)
- ✅ Added context words that make sense ("this", "the observed phenomenon")
- ✅ Correct verb form ("propose" not "proposes" with plural "scientists")
- ✅ Appropriate use of infinitive "to explain"

**Common mistakes to avoid**:
- ❌ "Scientists proposes theory explain." (Wrong verb form, missing words)
- ❌ "Theory scientists propose to explanation." (Awkward word order)
- ❌ "Scientists are proposing the theory for explain." (Wrong preposition)

---

### Sample Response 3

**Given words**: evidence / researchers / conclusion / based on

**Your sentence**: "The researchers reached their conclusion based on compelling evidence."

**Why this scores well**:
- ✅ Correct collocation ("reached their conclusion", "based on evidence")
- ✅ Added descriptive word ("compelling") that fits naturally
- ✅ Proper use of passive structure with "based on"
- ✅ Contextually logical (conclusions should be based on evidence)

---

### Build a Sentence Strategy

**Approach**:
1. **Identify parts of speech**: Which words are nouns, verbs, adjectives?
2. **Think of collocations**: What words naturally go together? ("conduct experiment", "propose theory")
3. **Choose a structure**: Simple subject-verb-object usually works best
4. **Add necessary words**: Articles (a, an, the), prepositions (in, on, at), connectors
5. **Check grammar**: Subject-verb agreement, verb tense, word order

**Top Tip**: Don't overcomplicate. A simple, grammatically perfect sentence scores better than a complex sentence with errors.

---

## Task 2: Write an Email Sample Responses

### What is Write an Email?

**Format**: Respond to a campus scenario or academic situation via email

**Time**: ~10 minutes
**Word Count**: 100-150 words
**Scoring**: Appropriate tone, clear purpose, complete information, professional format

**Types of emails**:
- Campus services (library, registration, IT support)
- Academic matters (professor communication, group projects)
- Administrative issues (housing, financial aid, schedule changes)

---

### Sample Email 1: Academic Request

**Prompt**:

**Sample Response** (135 words):

```
Subject: Request for Class Materials - Medical Absence

Dear Professor Chen,

I am writing to inform you that I will be unable to attend next Tuesday's lecture due to a scheduled medical appointment that I cannot reschedule.

I understand we will be covering the Industrial Revolution's impact on urbanization, and I do not want to fall behind. Would it be possible to receive the lecture slides and any handouts from that class? Additionally, if there are any assignments or activities I will miss, I would greatly appreciate guidance on how to complete them independently.

I plan to review the chapter beforehand and will follow up with questions during your office hours on Thursday if needed.

Thank you for your understanding and flexibility.

Sincerely,
Maria Santos
```

**Why this scores well**:
- ✅ Clear subject line identifies purpose
- ✅ Professional greeting and sign-off

- ✅ Makes specific, reasonable requests (slides, handouts, guidance)
- ✅ Shows responsibility (mentions reviewing beforehand, attending office hours)
- ✅ Polite, respectful tone throughout
- ✅ Appropriate length (135 words)
- ✅ Proper email format with paragraphs

---

### Sample Email 2: Campus Services

**Prompt**:
> The library computer you reserved is not working. Write an email to the library IT desk explaining the problem and requesting assistance.

**Sample Response** (118 words):

```
Subject: Computer Malfunction - Workstation 12A

Hello,

I reserved Computer Workstation 12A for 2:00-4:00 PM today (Reservation #45892), but the computer will not start. The monitor turns on, but the system does not boot up—I see only a black screen with a blinking cursor.

I have a research paper due tomorrow and need access to the library databases urgently. Could someone assist me with this computer, or could I be transferred to another available workstation?

I am currently waiting at Workstation 12A on the second floor. Please let me know how I should proceed.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,
James Liu
```

**Why this scores well**:
- ✅ Specific problem description (black screen, blinking cursor)
- ✅ Includes relevant details (workstation number, reservation number)
- ✅ Explains urgency appropriately (paper due tomorrow)
- ✅ Suggests solutions (fix computer OR transfer to another)
- ✅ States current location for quick resolution
- ✅ Professional but slightly less formal than professor email (appropriate for IT desk)

---

### Sample Email 3: Group Project Coordination

**Prompt**:
> Your group project team needs to meet, but one member suggested a time that doesn't work for you. Write an email proposing alternative meeting times.

**Sample Response** (142 words):

```
Subject: Re: Group Meeting Time - Alternative Suggestions

Hi everyone,

Thank you, Sarah, for suggesting Wednesday at 6 PM. Unfortunately, I have a lab that runs until 7 PM on Wednesdays, so I cannot make that time.

I am available during these alternative times this week:
- Tuesday, 3:00-5:00 PM
- Thursday, 2:00-6:00 PM
- Friday, 10:00 AM-3:00 PM

Would any of these work for everyone? If not, I could potentially meet over the weekend on Saturday morning.

Since our project outline is due next Monday, we should finalize the meeting time by tonight if possible. I'm flexible and happy to work around the majority's schedule.

Looking forward to collaborating with you all!

Best,
Alex
```

**Why this scores well**:
- ✅ Responds directly to previous suggestion
- ✅ Politely explains constraint (lab schedule)
- ✅ Offers multiple specific alternatives (dates + times)
- ✅ Shows flexibility (weekend option)
- ✅ References deadline to emphasize urgency appropriately
- ✅ Friendly, collaborative tone (appropriate for peer communication)
- ✅ Uses bullet points for clarity (modern email convention)

---

### Email Writing Strategy

**Structure to follow**:
1. **Subject Line**: Specific and informative
2. **Greeting**: Dear [Professor Last Name] / Hello / Hi [First Name] (match formality to recipient)
3. **Opening**: State purpose immediately (1 sentence)
4. **Body**: Explain situation + make request/offer solution (2-3 sentences)
5. **Closing**: Thank recipient + indicate next steps (1 sentence)
6. **Sign-off**: Sincerely/Best regards/Best (match formality) + Your name

**Tone Guidelines**:
- **Professor emails**: Formal, respectful, use title (Dr., Professor)
- **Administrative emails**: Professional, clear, specific
- **Peer emails**: Friendly professional, first names acceptable

**Common Mistakes**:
- ❌ Too casual ("Hey prof, can't make it tmrw lol")
- ❌ Too wordy (over 200 words)
- ❌ Vague ("I need help with something")
- ❌ No clear request or purpose
- ❌ Missing greeting or sign-off

---

## Task 3: Integrated Writing Sample Response

### What is Integrated Writing?

**Format**: Read passage (3 mins) → Listen to lecture (2-3 mins) → Write summary (9 mins)

**Word Count**: 400+ words (increased from 300 words in old format)
**Scoring**: Accurate summary of both sources, clear organization, good grammar

**Key Change for 2026**: Now requires **400+ words** instead of 300, and you have **9 minutes** instead of 20 minutes. This means you must write efficiently while being thorough.

---

### Sample Integrated Writing Prompt

**Reading Passage** (summarized for brevity):

*Topic: The benefits of working from home*

The passage discusses three benefits of remote work:
1. Increased productivity due to fewer office distractions
2. Better work-life balance with flexible schedules
3. Environmental benefits from reduced commuting

**Lecture** (summarized):

The professor challenges each point:
1. Productivity: Home has different distractions (family, household tasks), and collaboration suffers
2. Work-life balance: Actually blurs boundaries, leads to overwork
3. Environment: Energy consumption shifts to homes (heating, cooling), not eliminated

---

### Sample Response (420 words)

The reading passage and the lecture both address the topic of remote work, but they present opposing perspectives on its benefits. While the reading argues that working from home offers significant advantages, the lecture challenges each of these purported benefits with counterarguments.

**Productivity Argument**

The reading claims that remote work increases productivity because employees face fewer office distractions such as unnecessary meetings and colleague interruptions. According to the passage, workers can focus more deeply on their tasks in a home environment.

However, the professor contradicts this view by explaining that home environments introduce different types of distractions. For example, family members may interrupt work, household chores demand attention, and the lack of office structure can lead to procrastination. More importantly, the lecturer notes that remote work reduces spontaneous collaboration between colleagues, which is crucial for problem-solving and innovation. Therefore, any productivity gains from avoiding office distractions may be offset by these home-based challenges and the loss of collaborative benefits.

**Work-Life Balance Argument**

The reading suggests that remote work improves work-life balance by giving employees control over their schedules. Workers can adjust their hours to accommodate personal responsibilities, such as childcare or exercise, without the constraints of a fixed office schedule.

The lecturer challenges this benefit by arguing that remote work actually blurs the boundaries between professional and personal life. Without the physical separation of leaving an office, employees find it difficult to "switch off" from work mode. The professor provides evidence that many remote workers end up working longer hours than they would in an office setting, checking emails late at night or working on weekends. This suggests that flexible schedules can paradoxically lead to overwork rather than better balance.

**Environmental Argument**

Finally, the reading contends that remote work benefits the environment by reducing commuting, which decreases fuel consumption and air pollution. Fewer cars on the road mean lower carbon emissions overall.

The professor, however, questions whether these environmental benefits are as significant as claimed. She points out that while commuting-related emissions decrease, energy consumption shifts to residential areas. Homes are less energy-efficient than office buildings for heating, cooling, and powering equipment. When thousands of individual homes run heating and air conditioning throughout the day instead of a single centralized office, the total energy usage may not decrease substantially. Thus, the environmental benefits may be overstated.

In summary, while the reading presents remote work as clearly beneficial, the lecture systematically undermines each benefit with practical counterarguments and evidence.

---

**Why this scores well**:
- ✅ Meets word count requirement (420 words)
- ✅ Clear introduction establishing the relationship (opposing views)
- ✅ Organized by topic (productivity, work-life balance, environment)
- ✅ Accurately summarizes BOTH reading and lecture
- ✅ Uses transitions ("However", "Therefore", "Finally") effectively
- ✅ Shows relationship between sources (how lecture challenges reading)
- ✅ Paraphrases rather than copying exact wording
- ✅ Strong conclusion summarizing the disagreement
- ✅ No personal opinion (objective summary only)
- ✅ Written in 9 minutes (efficient organization helps speed)

---

### Integrated Writing Template

**Paragraph 1 - Introduction** (50-60 words):
```
The reading passage and the lecture both address [topic], but they present [contrasting/opposing/different] perspectives. While the reading argues that [main idea of reading], the lecture [challenges/supports/contradicts] this view by [main counterargument].
```

**Body Paragraphs** (100-120 words each, repeat for each main point):
```
**[Point Name]**

The reading claims that [specific point from reading]. According to the passage, [details or examples].

However/In contrast, the professor [contradicts/questions/challenges] this by [specific counterargument]. For example, [details from lecture]. The lecturer notes that [additional evidence]. Therefore, [conclusion showing relationship].
```

**Conclusion** (40-50 words):
```
In summary, while the reading presents [topic] as [reading's position], the lecture systematically [challenges/undermines/questions] each [benefit/argument/claim] with [type of evidence].
```

**Time Management**:
- Reading (3 mins): Take notes on 3 main points
- Listening (2-3 mins): Take notes on how professor responds to each point
- Writing (9 mins): Introduction (1 min) + 3 body paragraphs (6 mins) + conclusion (1 min) + review (1 min)

---

## Task 4: Academic Discussion Sample Responses

### What is Academic Discussion?

**Format**: Read a professor's question and two student responses, then add your contribution (100 words)

**Time**: ~10 minutes
**Word Count**: Exactly 100 words (or very close)
**Scoring**: Contributes meaningfully, engages with others' ideas, uses academic language

**This replaces**: The old Independent Writing task (which was 300+ words in 30 minutes)

---

### Sample Discussion 1: Technology in Education

**Professor's Question**:
> Some educators believe that technology enhances learning, while others worry it distracts students. Based on your experience, should schools increase or limit technology use in classrooms?

**Student 1 (Andrew)**:
> I think schools should increase technology because it makes learning more engaging. When I use educational apps, I actually enjoy practicing math problems instead of dreading them. Plus, technology prepares us for modern workplaces where digital skills are essential.

**Student 2 (Maya)**:
> I respectfully disagree with Andrew. While technology can be engaging, I've noticed it often distracts me and my classmates. During lectures, students check social media instead of paying attention. I think limiting technology helps us develop focus and critical thinking without constant digital interruptions.

**Your Response** (102 words):

```
I'd like to offer a middle ground between Andrew and Maya's perspectives. Rather than broadly increasing or limiting technology, schools should use it strategically. For subjects requiring practice and immediate feedback—like Andrew's math example—educational technology clearly helps. However, Maya raises a valid concern about distraction during lectures.

Perhaps the solution is context-specific policies: technology-enabled for independent practice and research, but minimized during lectures and discussions where focus matters most. This balanced approach would harness technology's benefits while addressing the distraction risks both students identified. We need thoughtful integration, not blanket adoption or rejection.
```

**Why this scores well**:
- ✅ Engages with BOTH previous students by name
- ✅ Adds new perspective (middle ground, context-specific approach)
- ✅ Uses academic language ("strategic", "context-specific policies", "thoughtful integration")
- ✅ Supports position with reasoning (addresses both benefits and risks)
- ✅ Exactly 102 words (meets requirement)
- ✅ Clear structure: position + reasoning + synthesis
- ✅ Respectful disagreement ("valid concern")
- ✅ Specific examples referencing earlier posts

---

### Sample Discussion 2: Work Experience vs Education

**Professor's Question**:
> When hiring entry-level employees, should companies prioritize candidates with relevant work experience or those with strong academic credentials? What factors matter most?

**Student 1 (James)**:
> Companies should prioritize work experience because it shows practical skills. Someone who worked in customer service actually dealt with difficult situations, while someone who just studied business theory might struggle with real interactions. Experience proves you can handle the job.

**Student 2 (Priya)**:
> I see James's point, but strong academic credentials demonstrate learning ability and theoretical knowledge. A candidate with excellent grades can quickly learn on the job, while someone with limited education might lack the conceptual foundation for advancement. University training develops critical thinking that experience alone doesn't provide.

**Your Response** (98 words):

```
Building on both James and Priya's arguments, I believe the answer depends on the specific role. For technical positions requiring specialized knowledge—like engineering or data analysis—Priya's emphasis on academic credentials makes sense because theoretical foundations matter. However, for client-facing roles like the customer service example James mentioned, demonstrated interpersonal skills through experience may outweigh GPA.

Additionally, companies should consider candidates with both: internships combining academic learning with practical application. This hybrid approach addresses both concerns, ensuring hires possess conceptual understanding and real-world competence.
```

**Why this scores well**:
- ✅ References both students' examples specifically
- ✅ Adds nuance (depends on role type)
- ✅ Provides specific examples (engineering vs customer service)
- ✅ Proposes synthesis solution (internships combining both)
- ✅ Exactly 98 words
- ✅ Academic tone ("specialized knowledge", "theoretical foundations", "hybrid approach")
- ✅ Shows critical thinking (situational analysis)
- ✅ Builds on rather than simply agreeing/disagreeing

---

### Sample Discussion 3: Required vs Elective Courses

**Professor's Question**:
> Universities require students to take general education courses outside their major. Should students have complete freedom to choose all their courses, or are required courses beneficial?

**Student 1 (Carlos)**:
> Required courses are beneficial because they expose students to diverse perspectives. Before taking a required philosophy course, I never considered ethical questions in my engineering work. Now I think about the societal impact of technology. Breadth makes us well-rounded professionals.

**Student 2 (Sarah)**:
> While I appreciate Carlos's experience, required courses often feel like obstacles to in-depth study. I wanted to take advanced economics seminars, but general requirements consumed my schedule. Students should pursue their passions intensely rather than spreading knowledge superficially across unrelated subjects.

**Your Response** (101 words):

```
Carlos and Sarah highlight a fundamental tension between breadth and depth in education. Research supports both perspectives: general education develops transferable critical thinking skills, while specialized focus builds expertise. However, I'd argue for a balanced requirement model.

Universities could mandate exposure to diverse fields—such as humanities, sciences, and social sciences—but allow choice within each category. For example, engineers like Carlos might choose from philosophy, literature, or history rather than being assigned one specific course. This preserves the breadth benefits Carlos values while honoring Sarah's desire for autonomy and engagement with personally meaningful content.
```

**Why this scores well**:
- ✅ Identifies the core issue ("tension between breadth and depth")
- ✅ References both students' concerns
- ✅ Uses academic evidence reference ("Research supports")
- ✅ Proposes specific compromise solution (choice within categories)
- ✅ Provides concrete example (engineers choosing among humanities)
- ✅ Exactly 101 words
- ✅ Sophisticated vocabulary ("transferable", "autonomy", "engagement")
- ✅ Balanced argument acknowledging merits of both sides

---

### Academic Discussion Strategy

**Structure** (for 100 words):
1. **Opening** (15-20 words): Reference previous students and identify your contribution
   - "Building on [Name]'s point..."
   - "While [Name] raises a valid concern..."
   - "[Name] and [Name] highlight a key tension..."

2. **Main Argument** (60-70 words): Present your position with reasoning
   - State your view clearly
   - Provide specific examples or evidence
   - Show critical thinking

3. **Conclusion** (15-20 words): Synthesize or propose solution
   - Connect back to others' ideas
   - Offer compromise or deeper insight
   - Summarize contribution

**Engagement Techniques**:
- ✅ Name both previous students
- ✅ Use their specific examples ("like [Name]'s example of...")
- ✅ Show relationship to their ideas ("Building on", "In contrast to", "Between [Name]'s and [Name]'s perspectives")
- ✅ Add new angle, don't just agree/disagree

**Academic Language**:
- Use transitions: "However", "Additionally", "Furthermore", "In contrast"
- Hedge appropriately: "may suggest", "research indicates", "often demonstrates"
- Sophisticated vocabulary: "nuance", "synthesis", "implications", "framework"

**Common Mistakes**:
- ❌ Ignoring previous students' posts (must engage with both)
- ❌ Simply agreeing without adding new insights
- ❌ Too casual ("I totally agree with Andrew!")
- ❌ Way over/under 100 words (aim for 95-105)
- ❌ No clear position or argument
