## New Introduction Paragraph (Add Before Existing Content)

### How Vocabulary Changed in the 2026 TOEFL

The January 21, 2026 TOEFL update didn't reduce the importance of vocabulary—it actually **increased** it in some areas:

**New Vocabulary-Focused Tasks**:
- **Reading: Complete the Words** - Fill in missing word halves using context clues (tests word families, prefixes, suffixes)
- **Writing: Academic Discussion** - Contribute meaningfully to academic conversations (requires precise academic vocabulary)
- **Writing: Build a Sentence** - Create grammatically correct sentences (tests collocations and word relationships)

**Why Vocabulary Matters More Than Ever**:
- Complete the Words specifically tests your knowledge of word structure
- Academic Discussion requires nuanced vocabulary to express complex ideas
- Shorter test format (90 minutes vs 120) means every word counts
- Adaptive testing rewards precision—vague vocabulary lowers your Module 2 difficulty

**Good News**: The vocabulary **types** you need haven't changed. Academic words from science, history, social studies, and campus life remain central. This guide's vocabulary list is **fully relevant** for the 2026 format.

### Why is the Ultimate Vocabulary List for the TOEFL special?

[**KEEP EXISTING CONTENT - No changes needed**]

**2026 Addition** (add at end of this section):

This list remains completely relevant for the 2026 TOEFL. The new **Complete the Words** task specifically tests your ability to recognize word families, prefixes, and suffixes—all covered in this vocabulary list. For example:

- **Complete the Words tests**: "The scientist's hypothesis was ___________able" (answer: "test" → testable)
- **You need to know**: Common suffixes like -able, -tion, -ment, -ness and how they transform word meanings

### Step 1 – Identify your vocabulary weaknesses

[**KEEP EXISTING CONTENT - No changes needed**]

**2026 Addition** (add at end of this section):

**For 2026 Test-Takers**: Pay special attention to these vocabulary areas for the new task types:

**Complete the Words (Reading)**:
- Word families: educate → education → educational → educator
- Common prefixes: un-, re-, pre-, post-, anti-, co-
- Common suffixes: -able, -tion, -ment, -ness, -ful, -less, -ity, -ous

**Academic Discussion (Writing)**:
- Transition phrases: "Building on that point...", "In contrast...", "This raises the question..."
- Academic hedging: "may suggest", "potentially indicates", "tends to demonstrate"
- Nuanced verbs: analyze, evaluate, synthesize, critique, propose

**Build a Sentence (Writing)**:

### Step 3 – Choose your flashcard style

[**KEEP EXISTING CONTENT - No changes needed**]

**2026 Addition** (add after existing flashcard styles):

**New for 2026: Word Family Flashcards**

Given the **Complete the Words** task's focus on word structure, consider adding word family cards:

**Front**: "Form the adjective from 'predict'"
**Back**: "predictable" (and show the pattern: verb + -able = adjective)

**Front**: "What's the noun form of 'solve'?"
**Back**: "solution" (show the pattern: verb + -tion = noun)

**Front**: "Opposite of 'reversible'?"
**Back**: "irreversible" (show the prefix: ir- = not)

This trains your brain to recognize word patterns—exactly what **Complete the Words** tests.

---

### Step 4 – Create your study schedule

[**KEEP EXISTING CONTENT - No changes needed**]

**2026 Addition** (add at end of this section):

**Adjusted for 2026 Shorter Test**: The TOEFL is now **90 minutes** (down from 120 minutes), but vocabulary study time shouldn't decrease. In fact, because the test is adaptive (Module 1 performance determines Module 2 difficulty), **vocabulary precision in early questions is more critical than ever**.

**Recommended 2026 Study Schedule**:
- **Weeks 1-4**: Core academic vocabulary (300-500 words from this list)
- **Weeks 5-8**: Word families, prefixes, suffixes (for Complete the Words)
- **Weeks 9-12**: Academic discussion vocabulary, transitions, hedging language
- **Daily**: 20-30 new words + review 50-100 previous words
- **Weekly**: Practice using words in Complete the Words contexts

**Time Investment**: Same as before (15-30 minutes daily), but now with **Complete the Words** focus.

## New Section: Vocabulary for Specific 2026 Tasks (Add Before Conclusion)

### Vocabulary Strategy for Complete the Words

**What this task tests**: Your ability to recognize word halves and complete them using context clues.

**Example question format**:
> "The research findings were **contro________ial**, challenging established theories."
> Answer: "convers" → **controversial**

**How to prepare**:
1. **Study word structures**: Learn common prefixes (un-, re-, pre-) and suffixes (-able, -tion, -ment)
2. **Practice word families**: If you know "contribute", can you recognize "contribution", "contributor", "contributory"?
3. **Use context clues**: The words around the blank will always hint at meaning
4. **Think grammatically**: Does the blank need a noun, verb, adjective, or adverb?

**Top 50 Word Families for Complete the Words**:

| Base Word | Noun | Verb | Adjective | Adverb |
|-----------|------|------|-----------|--------|
| analyze | analysis | analyze | analytical | analytically |
| create | creation | create | creative | creatively |
| signify | significance | signify | significant | significantly |
| observe | observation | observe | observable | observably |
| conclude | conclusion | conclude | conclusive | conclusively |
| predict | prediction | predict | predictable | predictably |
| produce | production | produce | productive | productively |
| construct | construction | construct | constructive | constructively |
| relate | relation | relate | relative | relatively |
| vary | variation | vary | various | variously |

- Create flashcards with word families
- Cover half the word and guess the completion
- Practice recognizing patterns (e.g., -tion always makes nouns)
