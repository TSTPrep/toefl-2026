WRITING STYLE ANALYSIS:
- Conversational, personal tone ("Ok, we get it")
- Uses humor ("Or just think you are weird")
- Direct address to reader ("You", "your")
- Practical, actionable advice
- Real-world analogies (driving a car, stage rehearsal)
- Numbered tips with descriptive subtitles
- Mix of short and medium paragraphs
- Uses rhetorical questions
- Includes downloadable resources
- NOT listicle format - has depth and personality

STRUCTURE:
- Introduction (problem statement)
- Preview of what you'll learn
- 10 tips (each with explanation, examples, resources)
- Conclusion with CTA

2026 UPDATE REQUIREMENTS:

5. Update Tip #8 timing (new prep/response times)
