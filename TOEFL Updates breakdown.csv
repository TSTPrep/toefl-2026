Section,Feature,Old TOEFL - before 2019/2023,Current - TOEFL iBT Enhanced - since July 2023,New TOEFL - after January 2026,Notes
Overall,Total Test Time,~3 hours,~2 hours,~2 hours,"The old TOEFL took approximately 3 hours, making it more demanding on endurance; the new version trims it to around 2 hours, making it more accessible and less tiring."
Overall,Section Order,Reading → Listening → Break → Speaking → Writing,Reading → Listening → Speaking  → Writing  (no break),Reading → Listening → Writing → Speaking,"The order of sections in the new TOEFL moves Writing before Speaking, potentially reducing test fatigue when writing responses."
Overall,Adaptive Testing,None,None,Multistage adaptive (Reading & Listening),The old test had fixed difficulty; the new test adapts the difficulty level in Reading and Listening based on the test taker's performance mid-test.
Overall,Number of Sections,"4 (Reading, Listening, Speaking, Writing)","4 (Reading, Listening, Speaking, Writing)","Same 4, reorganized and restructured","Both versions have four main sections, but the new TOEFL reorganizes task types and introduces varied formats within those sections."
Overall,Break,After Listening (10 mins),no break,Not explicitly mentioned,"In the old TOEFL, there was a fixed 10-minute break after Listening. This is no longer necessary due to shorter test length."
Overall,Scoring,"Raw → Scaled (0-30 per section, total 120)","Raw → Scaled (0-30 per section, total 120)","An updated score scale (1 - 6 in half-point increments). Updated score scale: We're introducing an updated score scale (1 - 6 in half-point increments) that more intuitively aligns with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), which guides many global students' English learning journeys.","Scoring remains on a 0-30 scale per section, but the new test applies Item Response Theory (IRT) to provide more accurate scoring in adaptive sections."
Reading,Time,54 mins (72 with 4 passages),35 minutes,~23 mins (adaptive),"Reading time is drastically reduced due to shorter, task-specific readings rather than long academic passages."
Reading,Number of Passages,3 (sometimes 4),2,"3 tasks: Complete the Words, Read in Daily Life, Read an Academic Passage","Instead of long texts, the new format introduces three distinct task types, allowing for better focus on different reading skills."
Reading,Passage Types,Academic (~700 words),Academic (~700 words),"Shorter passages (70-250 words), including real-life texts",Passages in the old test were long and academic; the new ones vary in length and include real-world texts like social media or forms.
Reading,Number of Questions,14 per passage (~30-40 total),10 per passage (20 in total),35-48 total (adaptive),"While the old TOEFL used a fixed number of questions, the new one uses an adaptive range depending on the student's performance."
Reading,Question Order,Follows passage sequence,Follows passage sequence,Varies by task type,Question order in the old test was linear; the new version's task-specific structure changes sequencing logic.
Reading,Skills Measured,"Comprehension, inference, vocabulary",,"Adds scanning, grammar, idioms, contextual guessing",New reading tasks test a broader range of micro-skills like contextual guessing and non-linear scanning.
Reading,Scoring,"Most = 1 pt, some = 2-3 pts","Most = 1 pt, some = 2 pts","Difficulty-based, IRT adjusted","The new adaptive model considers question difficulty when scoring, offering a more nuanced proficiency profile."
Listening,Time,~41 mins (up to 57),36 minutes,~27 mins (adaptive),"Listening time is reduced thanks to shorter, structured audio tasks replacing longer lectures."
Listening,Number of Passages,3-4 lectures + 2-3 conversations,"3 lecures, 2 conversations - 28 questions","4 tasks: Response, Conversation, Announcement, Academic Talk","Instead of fixed lectures and convos, the new test uses modular tasks that reflect real-life situations like announcements or short conversations."
Listening,Passage Types,Campus & academic (2-6 min),Campus & academic (2-6 min),"Shorter, structured task types","New listening passages are shorter and more varied in format, improving engagement and reducing fatigue."
Listening,Question Types,"8 types (gist, detail, function, etc.)",,Integrated practical questions,Question categories have been collapsed or restructured to reflect practical understanding rather than rigid types.
Listening,Navigation,Must answer in order,Must answer in order,Same,"Both tests restrict navigation between questions, maintaining consistency."
Listening,Scoring,1-2 pts per Q,"Most = 1 pt, some = 2 pts",IRT-based with difficulty modeling,Scoring in the new TOEFL now factors in both correctness and difficulty of items via IRT.
Speaking,Time,~17 mins,16 minutes,~8 mins,"The speaking section has been cut in half, with just two tasks instead of four, making it quicker and potentially less stressful."
Speaking,Number of Tasks,4 (1 independent + 3 integrated),4 (1 independent + 3 integrated),2 (Listen and Repeat + Interview),Task types shift from opinion and integration toward foundational (repetition) and practical (interview) formats.
Speaking,Prompt Types,"Opinion, conversation, academic",,Imitation + simulated interview,Simulated interviews and repeat-after-me prompts replace academic-style prompts to reflect everyday speaking more closely.
Speaking,Skills Measured,"Fluency, synthesis, pronunciation",,"Adds pacing, pronunciation accuracy, response logic","Fluency and pacing are now explicitly measured, offering a clearer view of spoken language proficiency."
Speaking,Scoring,Unified rubric,,Detailed task-specific rubrics,"Rubrics are now tailored to each task's format rather than applying a single, broad rubric across all tasks."
Writing,Time,50 mins (20+30),29 minutes,~27 mins,"The writing section time is nearly halved, but still measures core writing skills with concise tasks."
Writing,Number of Tasks,2 (integrated + opinion),2 (integrated + Academic discussion),"3 (Build a Sentence, Email, Academic Discussion)","Three tasks replace two, with greater diversity: grammar structure, genre-based writing, and discussion contribution."
Writing,Word Count,"150-225 (integrated), 300+ (opinion)","150-225 (integrated), 100+ (Academic)",100+ for discussion; others short-form,Word count requirements are relaxed in the new test to focus on clarity and purpose rather than length.
Writing,Essay Type,"Argumentative, structured essay",,"Real-world genres (emails, discussions)",Essays are no longer formal academic arguments only - email etiquette and online communication are now evaluated.
Writing,Scoring,Essay rubric,,Separate rubrics per task (genre-aware),"Each writing task is scored using criteria specific to that type of writing, leading to fairer evaluation."
Writing,Tools,No spellcheck,No spellcheck,Still no spellcheck; word count only,Both tests avoid auto-correction features to maintain integrity of language skill evaluation.
Design,Focus,Academic readiness,,Academic + practical communication,The old TOEFL emphasized academic English exclusively; the new version blends academic and functional communication.
Design,Task Authenticity,Simulated classroom,,More realistic & functional,"Tasks are now more grounded in real life - emails, announcements, interviews - rather than pure academic simulation."
Design,Foundational Language,Implied through use,,"Explicitly tested (sentence building, repetition)",The new TOEFL explicitly tests basic language mechanics like sentence construction and pronunciation repetition.
Design,Content Types,"Dense, lecture-style",,"Modular, interactive, task-specific","Instead of large monolithic passages, content is now chunked into specific task units to improve engagement and flexibility."
